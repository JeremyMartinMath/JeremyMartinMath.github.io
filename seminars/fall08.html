<i>The Topology of the Poset Poset</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: Let P be the poset of all posets on [n], ordered by 
inclusion of their sets of relations.  Bjorner and Welker proved that P is 
a ranked poset whose order complex has the homotopy type of an 
(n-2)-sphere.  We'll present their argument, and along the way will talk 
about useful tools in topological combinatorics such as supersolvability
and the nerve theorem.

<i>A Matroid-Friendly Basis for the Quasisymmetric Functions</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: Matroid base polytope decompositions arise in the work 
of certain algebraic geometers. In 2006, Billera, Jia, and Reiner invented 
a new invariant F(M) for matroids in the form of a quasisymmetric 
function. One motivating application of this invariant is to the study of 
matroid base polytope decompositions. The mapping of matroids to the 
algebra of quasisymmetric functions (QSym) behaves as a valuation on 
matroid base polytopes, and leads to a necessary algebraic condition on 
their decompositions.  Billera, Jia, and Reiner pose a number of questions 
regarding this relationship.  We address some of these questions, 
obtaining a full characterization for the rank two case.

<p>Along the way, we obtain a novel Z-basis for QSym that has especially 
nice properties.  For instance this basis has nonnegative integer 
structure constants and reflects, in addition to the usual grading of QSym 
by degree, a second grading of QSym that on (the images of) loopless 
matroids coincides with their matroidal rank.

<p>No familiarity with quasisymmetric functions or matroids are assumed 
for this talk.

<i>Products of Linear Forms and Tutte Polynomials</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: 
The Tutte polynomial of a matroid is a bivariate polynomial that captures
all of its invariants that behave nicely with respect to deletion
and contraction. In this talk I will review algebraic interpretations of
certain single-variable specializations of the Tutte polynomial. I will
then show how to simultaneously generalize two of them to capture the
whole two-variable beast. As simple corollaries, we'll see a few old
results from the literature as well as one or two new ones.

<i>Graph classes characterized both by forbidden subgraphs and degree sequences</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: 
Given a set F of graphs, a graph G is <i>F-free</i>
if G does not contain any member of F as an induced
subgraph.  We say that F is a degree-sequence-forcing set
if, for each graph G in the class C of
F-free graphs, every realization of the degree sequence of
G is also in C.  This definition is motivated by the
well-studied class of split graphs.  We prove that for any k there
are finitely many minimal degree-sequence-forcing sets with
cardinality k.  We also give a complete characterization of the
degree-sequence-forcing sets F when F has
cardinality at most two, and partial results when F has
cardinality three.

<i>Strengthening Kauffman-Murasugi via a Skeleton</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: One famous result in knot theory, the Kauffman-Murasugi
Theorem, is that the span of the Jones polynomial of a prime knot is less
than or equal to the crossing index of the knot, with equality if and
only if the knot is alternating.  In other words, nonalternating knots
have a span less than or equal to the crossing index minus one.  We
strengthen that result here, utilizing the nonalternating skeleton of
Bae and Morton.  This combinatorial method computes the extreme
coefficients of a version of the Jones polynomial through a constructed
graph.  Looking at properties of certain knots, we'll see that these
extreme coefficients are zero, hence strengthening the Kauffman-Murasugi
result.

<p>No prior knowledge of knot theory is necessary; the essential
definitions and examples will be provided.

<i>Riemann-Roch theory on finite graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: I will discuss recent works by Matt Baker and Serguei 
Norine. The classical Riemann-Roch theorem is a very powerful result 
involving the geometry and topology of a one-dimensional connected complex 
manifold. Baker and Norine proved an identical result for graphs. 
Applications include the existence of winning strategy for certain games.
