<em>Counting embeddings of graphs in state space</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We will define a labeled digraph \(G(b)\) on infinite binary strings with 
\(b\) 1's called \(b\)-ball state space. For a fixed digraph \(g\) we will 
calculate the number of embeddings of \(g\) into \(G(b)\) as \(b\) approaches 
infinity. It is commonly believed that the number of embeddings of \(g\) 
into \(G(b)\) is eventually a polynomial in \(b\), we will prove this for 
certain classes of graphs.

<em>Fractals and syzygies</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The Sierpinski gasket is a construction that appears in a number of 
mathematical contexts: fractal geometry, number theory (odd entries in 
the Pascal triangle), game theory (the Tower of Hanoi), and more. In 
this talk I will explain a new sighting of this object: when one tries 
to construct optimal monomial ideals with linear presentations. This is 
joint work with David Eisenbud.

<em>The Defective Parking Space: Tableaux and Catalan Convolutions</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Parking functions and their enumerative properties have been studied in 
depth in the field of combinatorics and in computer science as they are 
connected to the study of hashing functions. A well-studied result is 
the Catalan parameterization of the number of orbits of the standard 
parking space, the set of parking functions under the action of the 
symmetric group. We will introduce \(d\)-defective parking spaces, showing 
that defect is an invariant with regards to permutations. We establish a 
connection between the orbits of \(d\)-defective parking space and 
standard Young tableaux of shape \((n+d, n-d-1)\). Additionally, we 
provide a recursive formula for the number of orbits decomposing the 
\(d\)-defective parking space and establish an interesting link to Catalan 
convolutions.

<em>Laplacian Eigenvalues of Bipartite Kneser-Like Graphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The bipartite Kneser-like graph \(G(a,b)\) is constructed as follows. For any integers \(a>b>1\), let \(n=a+b+1\), then let \(\mathcal{A}\) be a set of all \(a\)-sized subsets of \([n]\). Similarly let \(\mathcal{B}\) be the set of all \(b\)-sized subsets of \([n]\). Draw an edge between a vertex in \(\mathcal{A}\) and a vertex in \(\mathcal{B}\) if their intersection is disjoint. We conjecture that all the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of this graph, denoted \(L(G(a,b))\), are all non-negative integers.

<p>We further conjecture a more precise formula for the multiplicity of any eigenvalue and what all the general eigenvalues are. Thus far, we have proved that: every eigenvector has a related pair with a similar eigenvalue and eigenvector, which implies the sequence of multiplicities is symmetric; that all the eigenvalues of \(L(G(a,2))\) are non-negative integers; established a transformation to a smaller matrix; and showed found a general formation of the eigenvector for any eigenvalue of \(L(G(a,b))\).

<em>Perfect Matching Complexes of Honeycomb Graphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 A <em> perfect matching</em> of a graph is a collection of edges, no two of which share a vertex.
The <em> perfect matching complex</em> of a graph is the simplicial complex on the edge set of the graph with facets corresponding to perfect matchings of the graph.
A <em> honeycomb graph</em> is the graph of a hexagonal tiling of a bounded region of the plane.  
In this talk, I give classes of honeycomb graphs whose perfect matching complexes are contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres.  
This is joint work with Marija Jeli&cacute; Milutinovi&cacute; and Julianne Vega.

<em>Matroids, polytopes, and beyond</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Given a matroid \(M\) on ground set \(E=[n]\) with basis system \(\mathcal{B}\), 
the <em>base polytope</em> \(P_M\subset\mathbb{R}^n\) is the convex hull
of the characteristic vectors of the bases.  Base polytopes offer a geometric way of
looking at matroids with a different flavor than the standard combinatorial
cryptomorphisms.  These polytopes are a special case of the <em>generalized
permutahedra</em> or <em>polymatroids</em> introduced independently by Edmonds
and Postnikov; these things in turn are a special case of <em>submodular systems</em>.
I will give an overview of all these lovely objects.  If time permits, I will discuss ongoing work of
Jonah Berggren, Jose Samper, and myself about another kind of submodular generalization
of matroids.

<em>Cut Complexes and Total Cut Complexes of Graphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We define the <em>\(k\)-cut complex</em> of a graph\(G\)as the 
simplicial complex whose facets are the complements of disconnected sets 
of size \(k\) in \(G\). We define the total <em>\(k\)-cut complex</em> 
of a graph\(G\)as the simplicial complex whose facets are the 
complements of independent sets of size \(k\) in \(G\). Both complexes 
are generalizations of the complexes developed by Eagon and Reiner to 
prove Fr&ouml;berg's theorem. In this talk we study the topological 
properties of these complexes and their relation to graph properties.

<em>Studying Combinatorial Games with SageMath</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Participants are encouraged to bring a laptop with <a 
href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> installed locally or have 
a <a href="https://cocalc.com">CoCalc account</a> to be able to follow 
along with the demonstrations.  <em>(Both of these are free -- talk to Jeremy if you need help.)</em>

<p>In this workshop, we will basic solution algorithms and optimizations 
for memoization and automorphism checking. We'll see how to study open 
problems, using computational results to guide conjectures and proofs. 
In addition to algorithms for solving game positions, we'll develop 
practical tools for displaying intermediate results. After applying 
these ideas to a simple example game, we'll see how to apply these 
techniques for online list coloring (paintability) of graphs.

<em>A very general yet mysterious operation on incidence algebras</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Partially ordered sets (posets) are combinatorial structures
underlying many mathematical problems: subdivisions of complexes,
matroids (e.g., graphs), representation theory and algebraic
geometry of Coxeter type objects (e.g., semisimple Lie algebras and
symmetric group). An invariant of a poset is its incidence
algebra, which contains much computable information about the
poset itself.

<p>In this talk, we will discuss a very general operation on the
invertible elements in the incidence algebra. This operation
generalizes the celebrated Kazhdan-Lusztig (KL) polynomials from
the Coxeter group to all finite graded posets. Time permitting,
we will show examples on how they apply to combinatorics
(subdivision of complexes, (local) h-vector), matroid theory
(q-deformed Mobius algebra in particular), representation theory
and algebraic geometry.

<em>Lattice Path Matroids and Ehrhart Theory</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 In this talk, we focus on matroid base polytopes of lattice path matroids. We will describe two approaches to discuss their Ehrhart theory. For 
the first approach, we give a description of the base polytope in terms of flats. For the second approach, we give a base polytope decomposition.

<em>Maximal Chain Descent Orders</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We introduce a new partial order called the <em>maximal chain descent order</em> on the maximal chains of any finite, bounded poset with an EL-labeling. We prove that the maximal chain descent order encodes via its linear extensions all shellings of the order complex induced by the EL-labeling strictly including the well-known lexicographic shellings. We show that the standard EL-labeling of the Boolean lattice has maximal chain descent order isomorphic to the type A weak order. We also prove that natural EL-labelings of intervals in Young's lattice give maximal chain descent orders isomorphic to partial orders on the standard Young tableaux or standard skew tableaux of a fixed shape given by swapping certain entries. We additionally show that the cover relations of maximal chain descent orders are generally more subtle than one might first expect, but we characterize the EL-labelings with the expected cover relations including many well-known families of EL-labelings.
