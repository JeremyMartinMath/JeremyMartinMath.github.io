<i>Counting Spanning Trees of Hypercubes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The Matrix-Tree Theorem can be used to give a simple
formula for the number of spanning trees of the n-dimensional hypercube.  
However, no bijective proof of this formula is known.  I'll discuss a more 
refined version of the formula, proven by Vic Reiner and myself, which we 
hope will point the way to a bijection.</p>

<li><b>Thursday 4/20</b><br>
Carly Klivans (University of Chicago)<br>
<i>Generalized Degree Sequences</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Degree sequences of graphs have been thoroughly 
studied. For example, there are many simple characterizations of when an 
integer sequence is the degree sequence of a graph and of graphs with 
"extremal" degree sequences. Notions of generalized degree sequences for 
higher dimensional simplicial complexes are not as well investigated. I 
will talk about work in progress on understanding these degree sequences 
and those classes of complexes which exhibit analogous extremal behavior. 
This is joint work with Uri Peled and Amitava Bhattacharya.</p>

<i>Ribbons, Caterpillars, and the Chromatic Symmetric Function</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
We are interested in Stanley's question of whether the chromatic symmetric function
distinguishes nonisomorphic trees. Instead of working with trees in general, we simplify to 
the problem of distinguishing between certain types of caterpillars. Then, using a bijection 
between ribbon diagrams and caterpillars, we look at what properties of the ribbons appear in 
the corresponding chromatic symmetric function.

<i>Tableaux combinatorics for the asymmetric exclusion process</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
The partially asymmetric excluion process (PASEP) is an important model from statistical
mechanics which describes a system of interacting particles hopping left and right on a
one-dimensional lattice of n sites. Particles may enter the system from the left with
probability alpha, and exit from the right with probability beta.  The model is partially
asymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the probability of
hopping right.  In this talk, we will describe a surprising connection between the PASEP model
and the combinatorics of certain 0-1 tableaux called permutation tableaux. Namely, we prove 
that in the long time limit, the probability that the PASEP is in a particular configuration 
tau is a
generating function for permutation tableaux of shape lambda(tau), enumerated according to 
three
statistics.
The tableaux in question come from total positivity on the Grassmannian (via work of 
Postnikov).
