<i>Kostant's Partition Function</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> In this talk we introduce Kostant's partition 
function which counts the number of ways to represent a particular 
weight (vector) as a nonnegative integral sum of positive roots of a Lie 
algebra. We provide two fundamental uses for this function. The first is 
associated with the computation of weight multiplicities in 
finite-dimensional irreducible representations of classical Lie algebras 
and the second is in the computation of volumes of flow polytopes. We 
provide some recent results in the representation theory setting and 
state a direction of ongoing research related to the computation of the 
volume of a new flow polytope associated to a Caracol diagram.

<i>What Is A Modulus On Graphs?</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We discuss the notion of modulus on graphs as first developed by Nathan 
Albin et al. in, e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7640">arXiv:1401.7640</a> and
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10112">arXiv:1805.10112</a>.  
The concept of modulus has its origins in analysis dealing with families of curves.  Modulus on 
graphs can be thought of as the discrete analogue to this idea.  We will cover some basic facts 
about modulus on graphs and in particular focus on using modulus with walks and trees of a 
graph.

<i>Deformations of Coxeter permutahedra and Coxeter submodular functions</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
One way to decompose a polytope is to represent it as a Minkowski sum of two 
other polytopes. These smaller pieces are naturally called summands. 
Starting from a polytope we want to explore the set of all summands. 
This set can be parametrized by a polyhedral cone, called deformation 
cone, in a suitable real vector space. We focus on the case where the 
starting polytope is a Coxeter permutahedron, which is a polytope 
naturally associated with a root system. This generalizes the type A 
case, which corresponds to generalized permutohedra. This is joint work 
with Federico Ardila, Chris Eur, and Alexander Postnikov.

<i>Rank Selection and Depth Conditions for Balanced Simplicial Complexes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> A simplicial complex is said to be balanced if its 
vertices can be colored so that none of its faces contain more than one 
vertex of a given color.  We focus on rank selected subcomplexes of 
balanced simplicial complexes, which are formed by excluding all 
vertices of a given set of colors.  In particular, we are interested in 
the depth properties of these subcomplexes and how they connect with 
those of the original complex. By passing to a barycentric subdivision, 
we discuss how our results can be applied to any simplicial complex.
This is joint work with Brent Holmes.

<i>The a,b,c,d,C,D,f,g,h of Polytopes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> I will sample some different methods in the 
enumeration of chains of faces of convex polytopes, and discuss their 
relationships.

<i>Independence Complexes of Finite Groups</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Understanding generating sets for groups is of 
interest in group theory, as certain problems involving groups are made 
easier by appropriate choices of generators. Our goal is to describe 
minimal generating sets for certain finite groups in a visual way. We 
will explore some interesting combinatorics that arises from this view. 
More specifically, let \(G\) be a finite group. We define an independent 
set of \(G\) to be a collection of group elements that is a minimal 
generating set for some subgroup of \(G\). These independent sets form a 
simplicial complex (called the Independence Complex) whose vertices are 
elements of \(G\) and whose faces of size \(k\) correspond to 
independent sets with \(k\) generators. We describe the structure and 
combinatorics of the resulting simplicial complex.

<i>Chip-Firing on Simplicial Complexes and Matroids</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The sandpile group and its relation to spanning 
trees has been studied extensively in the graphical setting in the 
context of chip-firing. A more recent area of research has been to 
generalize chip-firing results to a larger class of objects. In this 
talk, we explore chip-firing on simplicial complexes as well as regular 
matroids. Through combining these topics, we produce a bijective proof 
for Duval-Klivans-Martin's Simplicial Matrix Tree Theorem on a 
particular class of simplicial complexes. This bijection provides 
representatives for the elements of the sandpile groups for these 
complexes that depend only on a vertex ordering. This talk does not 
assume any prior knowledge of chip-firing or matroids.

<i>Generalized Flag Varieties: An Introduction</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Classically, a full flag in a vector space of dimension n is 
defined to be an increasing sequence of vector subspaces of length n, starting 
with dimension 0 and with increment 1. The collection of all such (full) flags, 
called the full flag variety, can be viewed as a Zariski closed subset of a 
product of Grassmaninan varieties, from which the collection obtains a variety 
structure, so that it is called a full flag variety. It can be seen that the 
general linear group acts transitively on this variety, the invariant subgroup 
of the action being the group of upper-triangular matrices, also called the 
Borel subgroup of the general linear group, so that the variety can be 
parametrized by the co-sets of this Borel subgroup. All these concepts can 
actually be generalized in the context of algebraic groups, where one can define 
a notion of Borel subgroups, and the homogeneous space of that is called a 
generalized full (sometimes also called complete) flag variety. And in general, 
a generalized flag-variety is the quotient space of a parabolic subgroup. In 
this talk, we will try to make sense of these concepts of Borel subgroups, 
parabolic subgroups and flag varieties in the general context of algebraic 
groups and mention in what way they are special and try to give some results 
explaining their geometry.

<i>Birkhoff polytopes of different type and the orthant-lattice property</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Given a \(d\)-dimensional lattice polytope \(P\), we say that 
\(P\) has the orthant-lattice property (OLP) if the subpolytope obtained by 
restriction to any orthant is a lattice polytope. While this property feels somewhat 
contrived, it can actually be quite useful in verification of discrete geometric 
properties of \(P\). In this talk, we will discuss a number of results for the 
existence of triangulation and the integer decomposition property for reflexive OLP 
polytopes. One such polytope which fits into the program is a type-B analogue of the 
Birkhoff polytope and its dual polytope, the investigation of which led to interest 
in this property.
