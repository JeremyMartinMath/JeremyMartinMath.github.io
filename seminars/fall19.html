<i>Type cones for cubes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The <i>type cone</i> (or <i>deformation cone</i>) of 
a polytope \(P\) is a polyhedral cone parametrizing all weakly Minkowski 
summands of \(P\). There are different descriptions of this cone; in 
this talk we follow McMullen's point of view and apply it to case where 
\(P\) is a combinatorial cube. The main result is that the type cone of 
any cube is simplicial. I will explain all of these terms in the talk, 
assuming no prior knowledge.  This is joint work with J. Doolittle, B. 
Goeckner, Y. Li, and M. Ross from a GRWC project.

<i>Gale Diagrams</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> This is a hands-on introduction to Gale diagrams,
which are tools to visualize high dimensional polytopes. We will go
over some examples in detail to get familiarized.

<i>Newton polytopes of multidegrees</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The multidegree of a multiprojective variety can be 
seen as a polynomial encoding the intersection of the given variety with 
products of linear spaces. For a product of only two projective spaces, 
the multidegrees were classified (up to a scalar) by June Huh in 2012. 
Describing all possible multidegrees, even up to scalar, seem an 
intractable problem. We will focus on a simplified problem: we explain 
where this multidegrees are supported.

<i>What is... a Hopf monoid?</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Very roughly speaking, Hopf monoids provide algebraic
structure to the process of putting combinatorial things together and
breaking them into pieces.  The things might be posets, graphs, matroids,
(quasi)symmetric functions, generalized permutohedra, or something else.
Hopf monoids can help understand the structure of these things and the
similarities between them.

<i>Positivity of Elser invariants of graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Veit Elser proposed a random graph model for 
percolation in which physical dimension appears as a parameter. Studying 
this model combinatorially leads naturally to the consideration of 
numerical graph invariants which we call <i>Elser numbers</i> 
\(\mathsf{els}_k(G)\), where \(G\) is a connected graph and k a 
nonnegative integer. Elser had proven that \(\mathsf{els}_1(G)=0\) for 
all \(G\). By interpreting the Elser numbers as Euler characteristics of 
appropriate simplicial complexes called <i>nucleus complexes</i>, we 
prove that for all graphs \(G\), they are nonpositive when \(k=0\) and 
nonnegative for \(k\geq2\). The last result confirms a conjecture of 
Elser. Furthermore, we give necessary and sufficient conditions, in 
terms of the 2-connected structure of \(G\) for the nonvanishing of the 
Elser numbers.  This is a project from GRWC 2018, joint with Galen 
Dorpalen-Barry, Cyrus Hettle, David Livingston, George Nasr, Julianne 
Vega, and Hays Whitlatch.

<i>Generalizations of Eavesdropping Games:  Greedoids and Multiple Bugs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The eavesdropping game consists of a graph and two 
players, Bob the Broadcaster, and Eve the Eavesdropper.  Bob and Eve 
each play their moves simultaneously, Bob chooses a spanning tree to 
broadcast, and Eve places a listening device (bug) on an edge.  Eve wins 
if she intercepts the message, otherwise Bob wins.  Clemens' Plus-One 
Algorithm can be used to approximate a Nash equilibrium to the original 
eavesdropping game.  We first adapt Clemens' Plus-1 Algorithm to a more 
general eavesdropping game in which the underlying graph is replaced 
with a pure simplicial complex or greedoid.  We also consider a 
generalization where Eve can place multiple bugs; these games come in 
two different categories depending on whether at least one bug, or all 
bugs, must be incident to Bob's spanning tree.

<i>Convexly generated ideals and Freiman inequality</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> 
Let \(A\) be a set of points in affine space whose convex hull has 
dimension \(d\). A fundamental result in additive combinatorics by 
Freiman states that the size of \(A+A\) is at least 
\(d+1|A|-\binom{d+1}{2}\). The inequality can be rephrased as an 
inequality about the number of generators of the square of a monomial 
ideals. In this talk I will present generalizations of this result using 
algebraic methods, which also suggest a projective version of the 
original inequality.

<i>Generalizing the Eagon-Reiner Theorem</i>
<p><u>Abstract:</u> 
In 1990, Fr&ouml;berg proved that a graph \(G\) is chordal if and only if 
a certain monomial ideal \(I(G^c)\) has a linear resolution. In this talk I discuss the connections 
between graphs, simplicial complexes, and monomial ideals, then give an 
extension of Fr&ouml;berg's theorem to a different kind of graph ideals.
