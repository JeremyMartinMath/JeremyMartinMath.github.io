<i>Combinatorial reciprocity theorems for pruned inside-out polytopes and their application to generalized permutahedra and hypergraphs</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_bpzk1din">Video</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>:
Generalized permutahedra are a class of polytopes with many interesting 
combinatorial subclasses. We introduce pruned inside-out polytopes, a 
generalization of inside-out polytopes introduced by Beck-Zaslavsky 
(2006),which have many applications such as recovering the famous 
reciprocity result for graph colorings by Stanley. We study the integer 
point count of pruned inside-out polytopes by applying classical Ehrhart 
polynomials and Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity. This yields a geometric 
perspective on and a generalization of a combinatorial reciprocity 
theorem for generalized permutahedra by Aguiar-Ardila (2017) and 
Billera-Jia-Reiner (2009). Applying this reciprocity theorem to 
hypergraphic polytopes allows us to give an arguably simpler proof of a 
recent combinatorial reciprocity theorem for hypergraph colorings by 
Aval-Karaboghossian-Tanasa (2020). Our proof relies, aside from the 
reciprocity for generalized permutahedra, only on elementary geometric 
and combinatorial properties of hypergraphs and their associated 
polytopes. In this talk we will focus on the application to hypergraphs 
and their polytopes.

Jeremy Martin<br> <i>What is... Schubert calculus?</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_07or6btl">Video</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> I will give an introduction to Schubert calculus on 
Grassmannians and flag varieties, assuming that the audience has never 
heard of any of these words before. I will use <a 
href="https://jlmartin.ku.edu/CombinatoricsNotes.pdf">my algebraic 
combinatorics lecture notes</a> (sections 11.4 and 11.5).

<i>What is... Schubert calculus? (part 2)</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_yqab23du">Video</a>

<p><u>Comment:</u> At the end of the talk, I got asked the question, 
&quot;So, what is Schubert calculus?&quot; Here is answer: it is about 
using combinatorics (thr symmetric group, partitions, tableaux) to model
and solving geometry and topology problems involving linear subspaces and 
configurations of linear subspaces.

<i>Convexity in Ordered Matroids and the Generalized External Order</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_3evutlfc">Video</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> In this talk we will use generalized matroid 
activity to construct the &quot;external order&quot; on the independent sets of an 
ordered matroid.  The poset simultaneously generalizes the active orders 
on matroid bases first studied by Bj&ouml;rner, as well as the discrete 
convexity theory of Las Vergnas and Edelman for oriented matroids.  We 
will relate the defining operator of the external order to the theory of 
anti-exchange closure functions and convex geometries, and we will 
discuss a dual view of the order from the perspective of the class of 
greedoids called antimatroids.  Time permitting, we will characterize 
the lattices isomorphic to the external order.

<i>Triangulations, Order Polytopes and Generalized Snake Posets</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_0m0biv5z">Video</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> In this talk, we will introduce generalized snake 
posets \(Q\) and investigate circuits, flips, and regular triangulations of 
the corresponding order polytopes \(O(Q)\). In particular, we will begin 
with an introduction and some basic properties of \(O(Q)\) for certain \(Q\). By 
the end of the talk we will find ourselves immersed in the secondary 
polytope of \(O(Q)\) and considering &quot;twists&quot; which extend to an action on 
regular triangulations. This work is joint with the Kentucky Crew: 
Matias von Bell, Benjamin Braun, Derek Henely, Khrystyna Serhiyenko, 
Andr&eacute;s Vindas Mel&eacute;ndez, and Martha Yip.

<i>When is the quotient of a semigroup ring by a monomial ideal Cohen-Macaulay?</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_wzf4dmet">Video</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We give a new combinatorial criterion for quotients 
of affine semigroup rings by monomial ideals to be Cohen-Macaulay, by 
computing the homology of finitely many polyhedral complexes.  This 
provides a common generalization of well-known criteria for affine 
semigroup rings and monomial ideals in polynomial rings. This is joint 
work with Laura Matusevich.

<i>Which Schubert varieties are Hessenberg varieties? </i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Schubert varieties are subvarieties of the flag 
variety parametrized by permutations; they induce an important basis for 
the cohomology of the flag variety. Hessenberg varieties are also 
subvarieties of the flag variety with connections to both algebraic 
combinatorics and representation theory. I will discuss joint work with 
Martha Precup and John Shareshian in which we investigate which Schubert 
varieties in the full flag variety are Hessenberg varieties.
