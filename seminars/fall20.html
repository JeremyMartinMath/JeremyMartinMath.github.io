<i>Lattice Polytopes from Schur Polynomials</i> 
(<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_9bp3wpws">Recording</a>)

<p><u>Abstract:</u> 
Given a polynomial (in any number of variables) we define a
polytope, called the Newton polytope, which is the convex hull of the
exponent vectors occurring (with nonzero coefficient) in the polynomial.
Information about Newton polytopes can shed light on families of
polynomials.  In this talk I report on a study of some combinatorial
properties of the Newton polytopes of Schur polynomials, which enumerate 
certain tableaux.  
This work was the result of a <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/grwc">GRWC 2019</a> project, and is joint with 
Bennet Goeckner, Su Ji Hong, Tyrrell McAllister, McCabe Olsen, Casey Pinckney, Julianne Vega and Martha Yip.

<i>Combinatorial Hopf monoids and flag f-vectors</i>
(<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_eiy0j7vb">Recording</a> -- second half only, sorry!)

<p><u>Abstract:</u> A combinatorial Hopf monoid in species provides an 
algebraic framework for understanding many polynomial and quasisymmetric 
function invariants in combinatorics. In this talk, we will discuss the 
problem of determining when the quasisymmetric functions associated to a 
combinatorial Hopf monoid are related to the flag \(f\)-vector of a family 
of relative simplicial complexes. We also discuss inequalities we obtain 
for the quasisymmetric functions in this situation, and describe some 
new examples of quasisymmetric functions, and combinatorial Hopf 
monoids. If there is time, we will also discuss \(F\)-positivity.

<i>Cones of Hyperplane Arrangements through the Varchenko-Gel'fand Ring</i>
(<a href="https://jlmartin.ku.edu/seminars/DorpalenBarry20201030.pdf">Slides</a> |
 <a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_w3sjmp0g">Recording</a>)

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of an arrangement in a 
real vector space have many interpretations. An interesting one is 
provided by the Varchenko-Gel'fand ring, which is the ring of functions 
from the chambers of the arrangement to the integers with pointwise 
multiplication. Varchenko and Gel'fand gave a simple presentation for 
this ring, along with a filtration whose associated graded ring has its 
Hilbert function given by the coefficients of the characteristic 
polynomial. We generalize these results to cones defined by 
intersections of halfspaces of some of the hyperplanes. Time permitting, 
we will discuss Varchenko-Gel'fand analogues of some well-known results 
in the Orlik-Solomon algebra regarding Koszulity and supersolvable 
arrangements.

<i>An interesting quotient of the Hopf monoid of generalized permutahedra</i>
(<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_5z451sm0">Recording</a>)

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We consider the Hopf monoid \(\Pi\) of generalized permutahedra modulo certain valuation relations. 
Following McMullen's construction of the Polytope Algebra, we endow the resulting spaces \(\Pi[I]\) with the structure of 
finite-dimensional graded algebras. The interaction between the algebra and the Hopf monoid structure leads to an 
interesting question about certain &quot;double-eigenspaces&quot;, whose dimensions turn out to count permutations with a 
given number of cycles and excedances. Time permitting, we will discuss a similar result for the family of type B 
generalized permutahedra.

<i>Mixed volumes = Mixed multiplicities</i>
(<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_rwp42sc0">Recording</a>)

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We show that the mixed volumes of arbitrary convex 
bodies are equal to mixed multiplicities of graded families of monomial 
ideals. This is joint work with Yairon Cid-Ruiz.

<i>Hadamard product of free monoids and universal Hopf monoid</i>
(<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/Combinatorics+Seminar/1_x1980mxb">Recording</a>)

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The Hadamard product \(*\) is a basic operation on species which mirrors the familiar Hadamard 
product of power series. Aguiar and Mahajan introduced a new operation on species \(\cdot\), based on set 
compositions, which intertwines with the Hadamard product via the free monoid functor. In particular, this 
provides an explicit basis for the Hadamard product of two free monoids in terms of bases of the factors. Using 
the product \(\cdot\), we define the notion of \(\star\)-character of a Hopf monoid. In this work we show that the 
category of such elements has a terminal object, which maps via the Fock functor to a Hopf algebra based on 
permutations, related to the notion of permutation patterns.
