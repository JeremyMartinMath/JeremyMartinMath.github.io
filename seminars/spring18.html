<h2>KU Combinatorics Seminar<br>
Spring 2018</h2>

<p>The Combinatorics Seminar meets on <strong>Wednesdays</strong> in Snow 408 from 3-4pm.

<p>Please contact <a href="index.html">Jeremy Martin</a>
if you are interested in speaking.

<p>Good general seminar-attending advice, especially for graduate students: <a href="http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/threethings.html">The &quot;Three Things&quot; Exercise for getting things out of talks</a> by Ravi Vakil

Joseph Doolittle<br>
<em>Partition Extenders</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
In this talk, we will discuss partitions of simplicial complexes, and their relationship to the
\(h\)-vector of the complex. We will show that while not every simplicial complex is partitionable,
every simplicial complex does have a partition extender. This will allow a combinatorial
interpretation of the \(h\)-vector of any pure simplicial complex. We further show some bounds on
the size of a partition extender as well as some difficulties that arise when attempting to
construct minimal partion extenders.

Federico Castillo<br>
<em>Hodge theory in combinatorics: an overview</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
We take a general look into the recent proof (by 
Adiprasito-Huh-Katz) of Rota's conjecture that the absolute value of the 
coefficients in the characteristic polynomial of any matroid form a 
unimodal sequence. The main point is to explain what all of those word 
mean, to give examples, and to mention a thing or two about the proof, 
which uses ideas from Hodge theory.

<p><strong>Wednesday 2/7</strong><br>
Federico Castillo<br>
<em>The Chow ring of a matroid</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We continue with the definition of the Chow ring \(A(M)\) of a matroid 
\(M\). This is modeled on Chow rings of wonderful compactifications and toric varieties of 
Bergman fans. However, this admits a completely combinatorial description which is what allows 
to extend known results to the non representable case. The key property of this ring are the 
Hodge-Riemann relations, a concrete, linear algebra condition.

<p><strong>Wednesday 2/14</strong><br>
Jeremy Martin<br>
<em>The Chow ring of a matroid, II</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> I'll give some geometric background (focusing more on ideas and less on 
technical specs) for what a Chow ring is, then we'll play around with the presentation of 
\(A(M)\) for some specific examples.

<em>Some metric and algebraic approaches to look at polytope graphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We give an invitation to the study of polytope graphs, with
particular focus on the diameter and the connectivity. The plan  is to
sketch a metric approach (joint with Karim Adiprasito) and an approach via
commutative algebra that lifts to hyperplane arrangements (joint with
Matteo Varbaro, Michela Di Marca).

<p><strong>Wednesday 3/28</strong><br>
Jose Samper (University of Miami)<br>
<em>Is the \(h\)-vector of a matroid a pure \(O\)-sequence?</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We discuss an old conjecture of Stanley asserting that the \(h\)-vector of a matroid independence complex is a pure \(O\)-sequence. We will discuss how ordering of the groundset of the matroid leads to a refined count of the \(h\)-vector and suggests a strategy to tackle the conjecture inductively. We then discuss a few refinements of Stanley's conjecture, how they reduce the problem to a finite problem in fixed rank. After that we discuss a few explicit large examples that elucidate some of the difficulties of the conjecture.

<em>The dimension of the negative cycle vectors of a signed graph</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> A <em>signed graph</em> is a graph \(\Gamma\) where the edges are 
assigned sign labels, either \(+\) or \(-\). The sign of a cycle is the product of 
the signs of its edges. Let \(\textrm{Spec}(\Gamma)\) denote the list of lengths of cycles in \(\Gamma\). We 
equip each signed graph with a vector whose entries are the numbers of negative 
\(k\)-cycles for \(k\in\textrm{Spec}(\Gamma)\). These vectors generate a subspace of 
\(\mathbb{R}^{|\textrm{\Spec}(\Gamma)|}\). Using matchings with a strong permutability property, we provide 
lower bounds on the dimension of this space; in particular, we show for complete graphs, 
complete bipartite graphs, and a few other graphs that this space is all of 
\(\mathbb{R}^{|\textrm{\Spec}(\Gamma)|}\).

<em>Go with the Flow: Combinatorial Applications of A Dual Linear Programming Theorem</em>

<p><strong>Wednesday 4/25</strong><br>
Hailong Dao
<em>On a conjecture by Conforti and Cornu&eacute;jols</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> 
I will discuss the conjecture in the title (which still carries a cash prize of $5,000),
which relates the max-flow min-cut property to a combinatorial statement. Also, I will
describe a stronger version, which can be proved for  graphs using some simple translation
to commutative algebra. A more detailed description can be found at <a
href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/291104/definition-of-packing-property">MathOverflow</a>.
