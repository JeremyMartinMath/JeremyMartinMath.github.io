<i>Ehrhart Polynomials of Base Polytopes of Lattice Path Matroids</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Given an integer polytope \(\mathscr{P}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the Ehrhart polynomial of \(\mathscr{P}\) is a fundamental 
polytopal invariant that enumerates integer lattice points contained in all nonnegative integer dilations of 
\(\mathscr{P}\). In 2007, De Loera-Haws-K&ouml;ppe conjectured that Ehrhart polynomials of matroid base polytopes have all 
coefficients nonnegative. In 2022, Ferroni showed that this conjecture is not true in general. However, this assertion 
has led to the major open problem to characterize Ehrhart polynomials for matroid base polytopes. In this talk, we 
focus on matroid base polytopes of lattice path matroids and give a formula for their Ehrhart polynomials.

<i>The whirling action on P-partitions and Rowmotion on chain-factor Posets</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We investigate the dynamics of certain natural actions on labelings of 
partially ordered sets (posets) and related objections. Rowmotion is an 
invertible map on order ideals of a poset which has received much 
attention recently from researchers in dynamical algebraic 
combinatorics. Of particular interest are the order of the rowmotion map 
and the homomesy phenomenon. In this talk we look at rowmotion on order 
ideals of posets of families not yet thoroughly investigated, including 
fence posets, obtained by arbitrarily ordering each edge in a path graph 
up or down. These posets are important in the theory of cluster algebras 
and \(q\)-analogues. The rowmotion orbits of antichains of fence posets 
can be succinctly visualized using certain tilings of a cylinder.

<p> Another family is the \(\vee\times[k]\) posets, where \(\vee\) is the 
\(\vee\)-shaped three element poset with two relations and one minimal 
element, and \([k]\) is a \(k\)-element chain. Here we make an equivariant 
bijection between rowmotion on order ideals and the whirling action, 
introduced by Joseph, Propp, and Roby, on \(P\)-partitions of \(\vee\). 
Finally we investigate whirling proper colorings of path graphs and 
cycle graphs. This is motivated as a generalization of toggling 
independent sets of a path graph, which itself has an equivariant 
bijection to rowmotion on order ideals of a special type of fence poset.
