<i>Parking Functions</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> A parking lot consists of \(N\) parking spots in a 
row along a one-way street, followed by a steep cliff.  One at a time, 
each of \(N\) cars enter the lot and tries to park in its favorite spot; 
if that spot is taken, the car car either parks in the next open spot, 
or drives off the cliff.  If \(p(i)\) is the favorite spot of the 
\(i\)th car, how many functions \(p\) successfully park all the cars?  
The answer may surprise you, and it has applications to hyperplane 
arrangements, spanning trees, and chip-firing games on graphs.

<i>Modular Catalan Numbers</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> There are many naturally defined sets which are 
enumerated by the Catalan number \(C_n\). The elements of these sets are 
called Catalan objects. Well-known sets of Catalan objects include 
binary trees with \(n\) internal nodes and parenthesizations of 
\(x_0*x_1*\cdots*x_n\) where the \(x_i\)'s are general fixed complex 
numbers, and * is an arbitrary binary operation. For example of 
parenthesizations, \(C_3 = 5 = |S|\), where \(S := \{a*(b*(c*d)) , 
a*((b*c)*d) , (a*b)*(c*d) , (a*(b*c))*d , ((a*b)*c)*d)\}\). If * is not 
arbitrary, then some of the parenthesizations may not be distinct. For 
example, if * is +, then every element of \(S\) is the same and \(|S| = 
1\). If * is \(-\), then the 1st and 4th members of \(S\) are both 
\(a-b+c-d\), so \(|S|=4\). In this talk, we will see a family of binary 
operations naturally indexed by positive integers \(k\) which generalize + 
and \(-\). (The operation is addition for \(k=1\), and it is subtraction for 
\(k=2\).) By the construction of this operation, the number \(N\) of distinct 
parenthesizations of \(x_0*x_1*\cdots*x_n\) satisfies \(1\leq N\leq C_n\). Fixing k 
gives a sequence \(C_{n,k}\) of numbers which enumerate restricted sets of 
Catalan objects. In particular, \(C_{n,k}\) is the number of binary trees 
with n internal nodes that avoid having a certain subtree (the forbidden 
subtree is determined by \(k\)). We will discuss combinatorial properties of 
the numbers \(C_{n,k}\) and other objects enumerated by \(C_{n,k}\). This is 
joint work with my colleague Nickolas Hein, who got a B.A. and M.A. in 
Mathematics from KU.

<i>Generalized Kostka polynomials</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Kostka numbers appear in several areas of 
mathematics; for example, in representation theory, they appear as 
multiplicities in the decomposition of permutation modules into Specht 
modules, and in combinatorics, they enumerate the number of semistandard 
tableaux.  Interesting combinatorics also arise from the study of 
various generalizations of the Kostka numbers, such as the charge 
statistic in the <i>q</i>-analogue of Lascoux and Schutzenberger.

<p>We study a two-parameter generalization of the Kostka numbers in 
connection with Macdonald polynomials.  In the case of Kostka numbers 
indexed by partitions of three rows or less, we give a combinatorial 
formula for computing these in terms of alcove walks.  This is joint 
work with A. Ram and M. Yoo.
