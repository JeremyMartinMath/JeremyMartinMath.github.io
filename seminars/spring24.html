<i>Chromatic symmetric functions I: Basics and Crew's conjecture</i>

<i>Chromatic symmetric functions II: Equivalence of the subtree and half-generalized degree polynomials</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Stanley introduced chromatic symmetric functions of 
graphs in a seminal 1995 paper and asked whether it is possible for two 
non-isomorphc trees to have equal CSFs.  This problem remains open today 
and is considered very hard.  I will discuss my recent work on deriving 
other graph invariants from the CSF, including Logan Crew's conjecture 
that the CSF of a tree determines its generalized degree sequence.  
(Don't worry, I will say what all these things mean and will not assume 
any prior knowledge about the CSF!)  This is joint work with Jos&eacute; 
Aliste-Prieto, Jennifer Wagner, and Jos&eacute; Zamora.

<i>The kernel of the chromatic symmetric function</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Stanley's problem about chromatic symmetric functions of trees can be reformulated linear-algebraically: does the 
kernel of the CSF, regarded as a linear transformation \(X\) from trees to symmetric functions, contain the 
difference of two trees in its kernel?  The reformulation suggests trying to understand the kernel of \(X\). For 
general graphs, the map \(X\) is onto, and its kernel is generated by the <i>modular relations</i> of Guay-Paquet 
and Orellana-Scott, and for forests it is generated by the <i>deletion/near-contraction</i> relations of 
Aliste-Prieto, de Mier, Orellana and Zamora.  For trees, \(X\) is not onto.  We find the dimension of the cokernel 
of \(X\) (it's something nice) and have a partial description of a generating set for the kernel.  This is joint 
work with Jos&eacute; Aliste-Prieto, Jennifer Wagner, and Jos&eacute; Zamora.

<i>Degrees of the stretched Kostka quasi-polynomials</i><br>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  The Kostka coefficient \(K_{\lambda,\mu}\) is the dimension of the weight space \(V^\lambda(\mu)\) in the 
irreducible representation \(V^\lambda\) of a complex semisimple Lie algebra. We provide a type-uniform formula for the 
degrees of the stretched Kostka quasi-polynomials \(K_{\lambda,\mu}(N):= K_{N\lambda,N\mu}\) in all classical types, 
improving and extending a previous result by McAllister in type A. Our proof relies on a combinatorial model for the 
weight multiplicity by Berenstein and Zelevinsky. This is based on joint work with Yibo Gao.

<i>Pattern-avoiding polytopes and Cambrian lattices</i><br>
<font color="red"><b>Zoom coordinates:</b></font> <a href="https://kansas.zoom.us/j/99294714793">Meeting ID 992 9471 4793</a> (passcode 2024)

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 In 2017, Davis and Sagan found that a pattern-avoiding Birkhoff 
subpolytope and an order polytope have the same normalized volume. They 
ask whether the two polytopes are unimodularly equivalent. We give an 
affirmative answer to a generalization of this question. For each 
Coxeter element \(c\) in the symmetric group, we define a 
pattern-avoiding Birkhoff subpolytope, and an order polytope of the heap 
poset of the \(c\)-sorting word of the longest permutation. We show the 
two polytopes are unimodularly equivalent. As a consequence, we show the 
normalized volume of the pattern-avoiding Birkhoff subpolytope is equal 
to the number of the longest chains in a corresponding Cambrian lattice. 
In particular, when \(c = s_1s_2\dots s_{n-1}\), this resolves the 
question by Davis and Sagan. This talk is based on ongoing joint work 
with Esther Banaian, Sunita Chepuri and Emily Gunawan.

<i>Defective Parking Functions and the Symmetric Group</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We recall that a parking function is a vector of parking preferences 
(spots) for cars that want to park in a one-way street. We can extend 
this definition to (\(m,n\)) parking functions, which has \(m\) cars parking in 
\(n\) spots (\(m < n\)). Although a lot of research has been done on these 
parking functions, we do not have a strong understanding of their 
"defective" counterparts, or cases where not all cars park. In this talk 
we will introduce defective parking functions and show results when we 
act under the symmetric group \(S_{n}\). We will then attempt to enumerate 
these objects and find a bijection with standard Young Tableaux.

<i>Schubert varieties and sphericity</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The study of group orbits and their closures inside flag varieties has 
a long and storied history. The development of this topic touches on, 
and interweaves, fundamental ideas from Lie theory, algebraic geometry, 
representation theory, and algebraic combinatorics. The foundational 
objects of study in this area are the orbits of Borel subgroups and 
their closures, the Schubert varieties. In this talk we will study when 
a Schubert variety is a spherical variety under the action of certain 
reductive groups. Spherical varieties generalize several important 
classes of algebraic varieties including toric varieties, projective 
rational homogeneous spaces and symmetric varieties. I will discuss a 
root-system uniform, combinatorial classification of Levi-spherical 
Schubert varieties for any generalized flag variety \(G/B\) of finite 
Lie type. This will be applied to the study of multiplicity-free 
decompositions of a Demazure character.
