<h2>KU Combinatorics Seminar<br>
Fall 2006</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Wednesday 8/23</b><br>
Jeremy Martin<br>
<i>Chromatic symmetric functions</i>
<br>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  The chromatic symmetric function X(G) of a graph G, introduced by 
Stanley in 1995, is an algebraic invariant that generalizes the chromatic 
polynomial of G. I'll explain all this, plus what a symmetric function is.

<li><b>Wednesday 8/30</b><br>
Jeremy Martin<br>
<i>Chromatic symmetric functions, II</i><br>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  This will be a continuation of last week's talk.  I'll explain how to 
use X(G) to recover all sorts of other information about G.  In 
particular, I'll discuss recent work of Matthew Morin, Jennifer Wagner and 
myself on the problem of whether a tree is determined up to isomorphism by 
its chromatic symmetric function.</p>

<li><b>Wednesday 9/6</b><br>
Ben Braun (Washington University in St. Louis)<br>
<i>Ehrhart theory and reflexive polytopes</i><br>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  A reflexive polytope is a lattice polytope P such that the dual of P is 
also a lattice polytope.  There are several other (equivalent) definitions 
of reflexive polytopes arising from Ehrhart theory and toric geometry.  
We will first survey some general properties of these objects and then 
discuss some recent results regarding their Ehrhart h<sup>*</sup> 
vectors.  More details can be found <a 
href="http://math.wustl.edu/~bjbraun/Research.html">here</a>.

<li><b>Wednesday 9/13</b><br>
Brendon Rhoades (University of Minnesota)<br>
<i>Triangularity in immanants</i><br>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  We define the vector space of immanants and study the transition matrix 
between two bases of this vector space, one defined by Rhoades and 
Skandera via Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and one defined by Desarmenien, 
Kung, and Rota. We prove that this matrix can be taken to be 
unitriangular. Then, we generalize to the full polynomial ring 
C[x<sub>11</sub>, . . . , x<sub>nn</sub>] and the dual canonical basis. 
The proofs of both of these results rely heavily on a partial order on 
S<sub>n</sub> defined using the dominance order. We define a 
’P-filtration’ of the vector space of immanants and determine where 
irreducible character immanants fit in this structure. This is joint work 
with Mark Skandera at Lehigh University.

Jeremy Martin<br>
<i>Higher Dimensional Spanning Trees: A Gentle Introduction</i>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  There are several different ways of extending the definition of a tree
from graphs to simplicial complexes.  My favorite, due to Kalai, is both 
topological (the definition relies on simplicial homology) and enumerative
(you can &quot;count&quot; them using a souped-up version of the 
Matrix-Tree Theorem).  I'll explain the definition, give examples, and 
perhaps discuss ongoing work of Duval, Klivans and myself on counting 
simplicial spanning trees of shifted complexes.  The talk will also
serve as background for Molly Maxwell's talk next week.

<li><b>Wednesday 11/8</b><br>
Molly Maxwell (University of Minnesota)<br>
<i>Higher Dimensional Spanning Trees</i>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  Simplicial trees are subcomplexes of simplicial complexes that provide 
a higher dimensional analogue of spanning trees in graphs. Kalai (1983) 
proved a version of Cayley's Theorem and the Cayley-Prufer Theorem for 
these higher dimensional trees.
 <p> A tree is said to be self-dual if it equals its Alexander dual (or 
<i>blocker</i>). When <i>k</i> is odd, an enumerator for the 
<i>k</i>-dimensional trees is the square of an enumerator for the 
self-dual trees. This result generalizes a graph theory result of Tutte to 
higher dimensions and partially solves a problem posed by Kalai.
  <p> We discuss a matroid framework that explains the common enumerative
thread in these two results.


<li><b>Wednesday 11/15</b><br>
Dimitrije Kostic (Texas A&M University)<br>
<i>G-Multiparking Functions and an "Anti-Searching" Procedure</i>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  In this talk, we give a new generalization of parking functions
called G-multiparking functions. We show how this generalization is in
bijection to rooted spanning forests, and how a generalized
graph-searching algorithm can generate a family of such bijections. This
algorithm also yields a categorization of the edges of the underlying
graph. Time permitting, we will demonstrate how this categorization
provides a new presentation of the Tutte polynomial. This is joint work
with Catherine Yan.
