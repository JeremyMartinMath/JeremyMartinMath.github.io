<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Geometrically carrying a trove of information about the underlying 
simple graph, the graphic hyperplane arrangement \(H_G\) yields an 
interesting mathematical object to study a simple graph \(G\). For 
example, one proves that the normal vectors of \(H_G\) are linearly 
independent if and only if they induce forests on \(G\) and the regions of 
\(H_G\) are in a one-to-one correspondence to the acyclic orientations of 
\(G\). With the graphic hyperplane arrangement we can associate the 
graphic matroid whose bases are spanning forests of \(G\). What 
information do we obtain if we apply duality, i.e., if we start with the 
dual of the graphic matroid, called the cographic matroid whose bases 
are complements of spanning forests of \(G\)? In this talk we are going to 
start answering the above question by constructing the normal vectors of 
the cographic hyperplane arrangement associated with the cographic 
matroid for simple, connected and bridgeless graphs.

<i>Simplicial Effective Resistance and Tree Enumeration</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 A graph \(G\) can be viewed as an electrical network, whose parameters 
are the resistances along its edges.  Remarkably, this model leads to a 
way to calculate combinatorial information about \(G\), including 
generating functions for spanning trees.  Also remarkably, my coauthors 
Woong Kook and Kang-Ju Lee have shown that the same method can be used 
more generally to enumerate spanning trees of simplicial complexes 
(which I will explain).  In particular, we can recover explicit formulas 
for <i>shifted</i> complexes (first obtained by Art Duval, Caroline 
Klivans and myself) and prove a new formula for <i>color-shifted</i> 
complexes (conjectured by Ghodrat Aalipour and Duval).  This is joint 
work with Duval, Kook, and Lee.

<i>Some new invariants of the edge ring of a finite simple graph</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Given any positive integer \(n\), there is a one-to-one correspondence 
between the collection of finite simple graphs on \(n\) vertices and the 
collection of squarefree monomial ideals of a polynomial ring in \(n\)
indeterminates over a specified field; this bijection is induced by the 
assignment of an edge \(\{i, j\}\) to the squarefree monomial \(x_i x_j\).
Consequently, the quotient of a polynomial ring over a field by a 
squarefree monomial ideal can be understood by studying the associated 
finite simple graph and vice-versa. One of the most celebrated examples 
of this relationship is due to Fr&ouml;berg, who showed in 1990 that the 
complement of a finite simple graph is chordal if and only if the 
corresponding squarefree monomial ideal admits a linear resolution. In 
joint work with Souvik Dey, we introduce two new invariants of a finite 
simple graph via the quotient of the complex polynomial ring by the 
corresponding squarefree monomial ideal. We demonstrate that all though 
these invariants are often quite subtle, they can be computed or bounded 
explicitly in several familiar cases. Even more, we show that these 
invariants behave well with respect to operations such as the join of 
two finite simple graphs or the wedge of complete graphs. We conclude by 
stating some questions and possible directions for future work.

<i>Subword Order: Topology, Homology Representations, and Enumeration</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_ybbgdq4r">Zoom recording</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We show that the homology module for words of bounded length, over an 
alphabet of size \(n\), decomposes into a sum of tensor powers of the 
\(S_n\)-irreducible \(S_{(n-1,1)}\) indexed by the partition 
\((n-1,1)\), recovering, as a special case, a result of Bj\"orner and 
Stanley for words of length at most \(k\). For arbitrary ranks we show 
that the homology is an integer combination of positive tensor powers of 
the reflection representation \(S_{(n-1,1)}\), and conjecture that this 
combination is nonnegative. We uncover a curious duality in homology in 
the case when one rank is deleted.
 <p>
 Our most definitive result describes the homology representation for an 
arbitrary set of ranks, as being almost a permutation module, modulo one 
copy of the reflection representation.
 <p>
 This talk will be self-contained. I will describe the techniques used 
to determine the topology and the homology representations via the Hopf 
trace formula. I will also present some open enumerative conjectures 
involving Stirling numbers of both kinds.

<i>Triangulations of Flow Polytopes, Ample Framings, and Path Algebras</i><br>
<a href="https://mediahub.ku.edu/media/t/1_2p5cd1mz">Zoom recording</a>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The cone of nonnegative flows for a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is 
known to admit regular unimodular triangulations induced by framings of 
the DAG. These triangulations restrict to triangulations of the flow 
polytope for strength one flows, which are called DKK triangulations. 
For a special class of framings called ample framings, these 
triangulations of the flow cone project to a complete fan. In this talk, 
we will characterize the DAGs that admit ample framings and enumerate 
the number of ample framings for a fixed DAG. Moreover, we will 
establish a connection between maximal simplices in DKK triangulations 
and \(\tau\)-tilting posets for certain gentle algebras, which allows us 
to impose a poset structure on the dual graph of any DKK triangulation 
for an amply framed DAG. Using this connection, we are able to prove 
that for full DAGs, i.e., those DAGs with inner vertices having 
in-degree and out-degree equal to two, the flow polytopes are Gorenstein 
and have unimodal Ehrhart \(h^\ast\)-polynomials. This is joint work with 
Matias von Bell, Benjamin Braun, Kaitlin Bruegge, Zachery Peterson, 
Khrystyna Serhiyenko, and Martha Yip.

<i>Weak Lefschetz Property for quotients by monomial ideals containing squares of variables</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Let \(\Delta\) be a simplicial complex on \(n\) vertices. The corresponding 
Stanley-Reisner ring is obtained from \(S = \Bbbk[x_1, \ldots, x_n]\) by 
quotienting out \(I_{\Delta} = \langle x_{i_1} \cdots x_{i_m} : \{i_1, 
\ldots, i_m \} \notin \Delta \rangle\), where \(\Bbbk\) is a field of 
characteristic \(0\). Let \(J_{\Delta}\) be the ideal generated by 
\(I_{\Delta}\) and the squares of the variables. \(A(\Delta) = 
S/J_{\Delta}\) is a graded artinian algebra. For a general linear form 
\(\ell\), \(A(\Delta)\) has the <i>Weak Lefschetz Property</i> (WLP) if 
the homomorphism induced by multiplication by \(\ell\), \(\mu_i : 
A(\Delta)_i \to A(\Delta)_{i+1}\) has maximal rank for all \(i\). In
joint work with Hailong Dao, we characterize the Weak Lefschetz Property 
of \(A(\Delta)\) in terms of the simplicial complex \(\Delta\). In 
particular, we see a complete characterization of WLP in degree \(1\) in 
terms of the edge graph of \(\Delta\). We shall also look at 
pseudomanifolds of small dimension and if time permits, some interesting 
corollaries including relating WLP with face 2-colorability of certain 
triangulations.

<i>Enumeration of Finite Semigroups via the Symbolic Method</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We introduce the symbolic method as developed in the seminal work 
<i>Analytic Combinatorics</i> by Phillipe Flajolet and Robert Sedgewick. 
We employ the method to derive generating functions that enumerate some 
interesting statistics relating properties of the full transformation 
semigroup \(\mathcal{T}_n\), the semi-group \(\mathcal{PT}_n\) of 
partial transformations, the symmetric inverse semigroup 
\(\mathcal{IS}_n\), and the semigroup \(\mathcal{B}_n\) of all relations 
on \([n]\). In particular, we count the number of nilpotent, idempotent, 
and group elements in each semigroup. We classify these semigroups 
according to various properties, including but not limited to: index, 
connected components, number of recurrent, fixed, defective, and 
undefined points. We derive probability generating functions for some 
distributions associated with the non-functional points of a random 
partial function.

<i>Semigroups and commutative algebra</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Semigroups are simple combinatorial objects which provide a wealth of 
interesting and beautiful examples in commutative algebra by forming 
what's known as an affine semigroup ring. In this talk, we will recap 
some of the basic definitions surrounding semigroups and discuss recent 
joint work with Vaibhav Pandey about affine semigroup rings.

<i>Commutative algebra and semigroups</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 In this follow-up talk from last week, I will focus a bit more on the
algebraic side. We will cover a tiny bit of necessary homological 
algebra, then demonstrate how the simple idea of &quot;\(p\)-nilpotent
embeddings&quot; of affine semigroups can help give interesting and
powerful information about otherwise mysterious local cohomology
modules of the affine semigroup ring.
