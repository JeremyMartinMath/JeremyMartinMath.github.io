<i>Packing equal spheres into d-cubes</i>

<p><u>Abstract</u>: Let n(r,d) be the maximum number of equal d-dimensional spheres of diameter 1 that can be packed 
into a d-dimensional cube whose edges have length r. We consider the problem of determination of n(r,d) for given r and 
d. Some exact values and estimates on n(r,d) are found. To get some lower bounds on n(r,d), one can use discrete 
mathematics and convex geometry as well. To get upper bounds, one can use polyhedral subdivisions of the cube and solve 
a corresponding optimization problem on few variables.

<i>Relations on solid angles of polytopes and polytopal complexes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The <i>i</i>th angle sum of a polytope counts the sum 
of the solid angles at <i>i</i>-dimensional faces of a polytope. We define 
the &gamma;-vector of a polytope as a linear combination of the angle sums 
in a manner analogous to the <i>h</i>-vector as a linear combination of 
the <i>f</i>-vector.  The Gram and Perles equations on angles give results 
analogous to the Euler and Dehn-Sommerville equations on the <i>f</i>- and 
<i>h</i>-vectors.  We consider how the analogy between the face structure 
and angle structure of polytopes continues, proving that the 
&gamma;-vector is non-decreasing for low-dimensional simplices and 
non-negative for low-dimensional simplicial polytopes.  As time allows, we 
will also consider an angle analog of the Euler characteristic, showing 
that it is half the Euler characteristic for a large class of polytopal 
complexes.

<i>Elliptic curves and chip-firing games</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> In this talk, I will begin by discussing chip-firing 
games on graphs, and how these yield a group structure on the set of 
spanning trees of a graph. In the second part, I will describe elliptic 
curves over finite fields, and how such objects also have group 
structures.  For a family of graphs obtained by deforming the sequence of 
wheel graphs, the cardinalities of these groups satisfy a nice reciprocal 
relationship with the orders of elliptic curves as we consider field 
extensions.  I will finish by discussing other surprising ways that these 
group structures are analogous.  This research was completed as part of my 
dissertation work at the University of California, San Diego under Adriano 
Garsia's guidance.
