<em>Magic and Antimagic Graphs and Hypergraphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Label the edges of a graph with nonnegative integers.  The labeling is <em>magic</em> if each vertex has the same sum of the labels on the 
edges incident to it.  The labeling is antimagic if the sums at the vertices are all different.  It is not known if every graph 
(besides \(K_2\)) has an antimagic labeling.  Fifty years ago Stanley showed that the number of magic labelings with sum \(r\) is a 
quasipolynomial in \(r\).  This talk will review Stanley's result, discuss the work of Beck and Fahramand on antimagic labelings, and 
present our attempts to extend results to hypergraphs.  This is work from a GRWC project with Amanda Burcroff, Tyrrell McAllister and 
Leilani Pai.

<em>Cluster algebras: an introduction</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 I will try to explain what a cluster algebra is and why there are 
important, using Lauren Williams' article &quot;Cluster algebras: an 
introduction&quot; [Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 2014] as my main source. I 
will not assume any background with cluster algebras, particularly since 
I have none myself.

<em>KKM-type theorems and their applications</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The KKM theorem, due to Knaster, Kuratowski and Mazurkiewicz in 1929, 
is a topological lemma reminiscent of Sperner's lemma and Brouwer's 
fixed point theorem. It has numerous applications in combinatorics, 
discrete geometry, economics, game theory and other areas. 
Generalizations of this lemma, in several different directions, were 
proved over the years (e.g., by Shapley, Gale, Komiya, Soberon) and have 
been widely applied as well. We will discuss a recent common 
generalization of all these theorems. We will also show two very 
different applications of KKM-type theorems: one is a proof of a 
conjecture of Eckhoff from 1993 on the line piercing numbers in certain 
families of convex sets in the plane, and the other is a theorem on fair 
division of multiple cakes among players with subjective preferences.

<em>Katzman and Ehrhart: A tale of two cities</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 In this talk, we will discuss some delightful connections between the 
Hilbert polynomial of a class of toric rings and the volume of a related 
polytope. In particular, we will try to demystify a paper of Moty 
Katzman, &quot;The Hilbert series of algebras of Veronese type,&quot; 
which is often cited in the realm of Ehrhart theory. No background 
beyond elementary algebra should be required.

<em>The Hopf Monoid on Edge Colored Digraphs</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Generalized chromatic functions were introduced by Aliniaeifard, Li, 
and van Willigenburg in a <a 
href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08458">recent preprint</a> to unify the 
theory of chromatic symmetric functions, chromatic quasisymmetric 
functions, and P-partitions. Generalized chromatic functions are defined 
from vertex-colorings of edge-colored digraphs and can be thought of as 
the image of a Hopf morphism from a Hopf monoid on edge-colored digraphs 
to the Hopf algebra on quasisymmetric functions. In this talk we 
introduce the Hopf monoid on edge-colored digraphs, its connections to 
the Hopf monoids on graphs and directed graphs, and give a 
cancellation-free antipode formula.

<em>Untangling the Brain's Web: Insights from Graph Theory and Network Neuroscience</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 In this talk, I will explore the applications of graph theory in understanding large-scale brain 
dynamics in network neuroscience. I will begin by introducing the basics of graph theory and its 
relevance to studying the brain. Next, I will discuss how graph theory is used to examine 
structural and functional brain networks and can reveal their organizational principles, such as 
small-worldness, modularity, and rich-club organization. Finally, I will showcase the use of 
generative models to predict the functional dynamics of brain networks and highlight current 
challenges and future directions in this exciting area of research.

<em>Applications of symmetric  functions for solving soliton equations</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
Symmetric  polynomials are polynomials of  several variables that do not change their value under any  permutations of variables. Their applications in modern mathematics are ubiquitous.  In this talk we will give a brief summary of the role of symmetric functions in  the theory of soliton equations. 

<p>Soliton equations are non-linear  partial differential equations that posses remarkable solutions in the form of stable traveling waves. The  modern study of these equations is  situated at the crossroads of various areas of mathematics. 

<p>It turns out, that  an infinite collection  of soliton equations with the name  KP-hierarchy  has common  solutions that can be obtained  from a family of symmetric functions called Schur symmetric functions, which are already famous for their important meaning in representation theory.

<p>We plan to overview main definitions and properties of symmetric functions, examples of solitons, explain the meaning of boson-fermion correspondence, and give general  outline of  steps  that lead to interpretation of  Schur symmetric functions  as solutions of  the KP-hierarchy.

<em>The Primitive Eulerian polynomial (and type B shenanigans)</em>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The coefficients of the Eulerian polynomial count permutations with 
a given number of excedances. The Primitive Eulerian polynomial keeps 
track of this statistic for "irreducible" permutations. We will explain 
what we mean by "irreducible" and state the corresponding 
result/definition in the case of signed permutations.
 <p>We will then define the Primitive Eulerian polynomial 
\(P_{\mathcal{A}}(z)\) for any central hyperplane arrangement 
\(\mathcal{A}\) as a reparametrization of its cocharacteristic polynomial. 
Previous work on the polytope algebra of deformations of a zonotope 
(2021) implicitly showed that this polynomial has nonnegative 
coefficients whenever \(\mathcal{A}\) is a simplicial arrangement. 
However, in that work, we only found a combinatorial interpretation of 
its coefficients when \(\mathcal{A}\) is the reflection arrangements of 
type A or B (permutations and signed permutations).
 <p>We also present a geometric/combinatorial interpretation for the 
coefficients of \(P_{\mathcal{A}}(z)\) for all simplicial arrangements 
\(\mathcal{A}\), along with some real-rootedness results and conjectures. 
Time permitting, I will discuss some relations between the type B 
Primitive Eulerian polynomial and other polynomials previously defined 
in the literature. Based on joint work with Christophe Hohlweg and 
Franco Saliola.
