<i>Hopf Monoids - A Refresher</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> This is an intentionally off-the-cuff talk, to 
simulate the answer I would give over coffee at a conference to the 
question, &quot;So what are these things called Hopf monoids and what do 
you do with them?&quot;

<p><strong>Friday 2/7</strong><br>
Federico Castillo<br>
<i>Hopf Algebras - Examples</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We are going to explore examples coming from group 
algebras, Lie algebras, symmetric functions, and posets. The goal is to 
see how Hopf algebras allow us to give a common framework for different 
situations.

Title TBA

<i>Colorful phenomena in discrete geometry and combinatorics via topological methods</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We will discuss two recent topological results and 
their applications to several different problems in discrete geometry 
and combinatorics involving colorful settings.

<p>The first result is a polytopal-colorful generalization of the 
topological KKMS theorem due to Shapley. We apply this theorem to prove 
a colorful extension of the d-interval theorem of Tardos and Kaiser, as 
well as to provide a new proof to the colorful Caratheodory theorem due 
to Barany. Our theorem can be also applied to questions regarding 
fair-division of goods (e.g., multiple cakes) among a set of players. 
This is a joint work with Florian Frick.

<p>The second result is a new topological lemma that is reminiscent of 
Sperner's lemma: instead of restricting the labels that can appear on 
each face of the simplex, our lemma considers labelings that enjoy a 
certain symmetry on the boundary of the simplex. We apply this to prove 
that the well-known envy-free division theorem of a cake is true even if 
the players are not assumed to prefer non-empty pieces, whenever the 
number of players is prime or equal to 4. This is joint with Frederic 
Meunier.

<i>Partition extenders and Simon's conjecture</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> If a pure simplicial complex is partitionable, then its h-vector has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of any partitioning of the complex. Such an interpretation does not exist for non-partitionable complexes. Given a non-partitionable complex, we will construct a relative complex---called a partition extender---that allows us to write the h-vector of a non-partitionable complex as the difference of two h-vectors of partitionable complexes in a natural way. We will show that all pure complexes have partition extenders.

<p>A similar notion can be defined for Cohen--Macaulay and shellable complexes. We will show precisely which complexes have Cohen--Macaulay extenders, and we will discuss a connection to a conjecture of Simon on the extendable shellability of uniform matroids. This is joint work with Joseph Doolittle and Alexander Lazar.
