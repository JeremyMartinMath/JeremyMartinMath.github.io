<i>Some properties of Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs and their possible generalization to simplicial complexes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The Laplacian matrix of a graph, and its eigenvalues, have played an important role in many areas of mathematics and computer science such as 
the theory of random walks and data clustering. In this talk we first review some well-known properties of Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs and their relation to several 
graph invariants such as the number of spanning trees, diameter, vertex connectivity, and expansion properties. Then we present the corresponding generalization of 
previous known results for Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs to Laplacian eigenvalues of pure simplicial complexes as uniform hypergraphs. Finally, we deliver some 
open problems.

<i>Matroidal vs. shifted simplicial complexes</i>
<p><u>Abstract:</u>
We will discuss a program to construct a class of ordered simplicial complexes that generalises matroid independence and pure shifted simplicial complexes and enlightens some of the similarties between these two remarkable classes of complexes. To this end we relax several of the classical matroid axioms such as the exchange and circuit axioms. We motivate such constructions by relating them to two classical problems: a 1977 conjecture of Stanley about the h-vector of a matroid and a question of Reiner and Duval about the similarities of matroidal and shifted complexes. We will present some of the consequences of the two mentioned axioms, like the existence of a well behaved Tutte-polynomial and a well defined nbc complex. We then pose several questions and, if time permits, explain briefly the other axioms we have considered. Based on joint work with Steven Klee.
