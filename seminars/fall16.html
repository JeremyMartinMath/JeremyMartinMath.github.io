<i>Arithmetical Structures on Graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Let \(G\) be a graph on vertex set \([n]\) with adjacenecy matrix \(A\). An <em>arithmetical structure </em>on \(G\) consists of 
a pair of positive integer vectors \(\textbf{d},\textbf{r}\) such that the &quotlgeneralized Laplacian&quot; \(A-\mathop{\rm diag}(\mathbf{d})\) has 
\(\mathbf{r}\) as a nullvector.  Arithmetical structures were introduced by D. Lorenzini [Math. Ann. 285 (1989) 481-501] in the context of algebriac 
geometry, but are of independent combinatorial interest.  In particular, Lorenzini have a nonconstructive proof that every graph has only finitely many arithmetical 
structures.  We look at the cases that \(G\) is a path or a cycle, where its arithmetical structures exhibit lots of Catalan combinatorics.  This is joint work with 
C. Alfaro, B. Braun, H. Corrales, S. Corry, L. Garc&iacute;a Puente, D. Glass, N. Kaplan, L. Levine, H. Lopez, G. Musiker and C. Valencia.

<i>Reconstructing nearly simple polytopes from their graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>

A theorem of Blind and Mani shows that a simple polytope can be 
reconstructed from its graph. Kalai gave a very elegant proof of the 
theorem using the invariant \(f^O=\sum_{v\in V} 2^{\textrm{indegree}(v)}\) as a way to measure goodness of an acyclic 
orientation \(O\). In this talk we will expand on the use of \(f^O\) and prove a 
new result about nearly simple polytopes, as well as showing a bound on 
the non-simplicity of a polytope which can be reconstructed from its 
graph.

<i>Multi-Derivations of Braid Arrangements</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
  In this talk we will discuss a class of hyperplane arrangements called graphic arrangements, which 
are sub-arrangements of the braid arrangement.  It is known, thanks to Stanley, that the module of 
derivations of a graphic arrangement is free if and only if the graph is chordal.  However, freeness 
of the module of multi-derivations of a graphic arrangement is not nearly so well understood, not 
even for the braid arrangement!  We will discuss a new criterion for freeness of the module of 
multi-derivations of a graphic arrangement.  Particular attention will be given to the case of the 
\(A_3\) braid arrangement, where this criterion has recently led to a complete combinatorial 
characterization of freeness of the module of multi-derivations.  No prior knowledge of hyperplane 
arrangements will be assumed.  This is joint work with Chris Francisco, Jeff Mermin, and Jay Schweig.

<i>Maximizing Independent Sets and Cliques</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The Kruskal-Katona theorem shows that the graphs with 
fixed numbers of vertices and edges that have the most independent sets 
are the lex graphs, which pile many edges onto only a few of the 
vertices. When we introduce degree restrictions that rule out the lex 
graphs, how many independent sets can be achieved? Extremal problems 
concerning the number of independent sets or, complementarily, the 
number of cliques have been well studied in recent years by Galvin; 
Cutler and Radcliffe; and Gan, Loh, and Sudakov. We are interested in 
the problem of maximizing the number of triangles among graphs with \(m\) 
edges and maximum degree at most \(r\). We prove that for a fixed \(r \le 
7\) and any given \(m\), the maximum number of triangles is achieved by 
taking as many disjoint copies of \(K_{r+1}\) as possible and forming a 
colex graph with the remaining edges.

On &quot;Relations between cumulants in noncommutative probability&quot; by O. Arizmendi, T. Hasebe, F. Lehner, and C. Vargas
[<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870815001978/pdfft?md5=efa4be08338378e53d8e0ae609d11880&pid=1-s2.0-S0001870815001978-main.pdf">Adv. Math. <b>282</b> (2015), 56-92.</a>]

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
Cumulants provide a combinatorial description of independence of random 
variables. When working with noncommutative probability spaces, there 
exist different notions of independence, which in turn induce different 
types of cumulants. In this talk we consider the relation between two 
type of independences: Boolean and tensor. Using combinatorial tools, we 
find an explicit expression for the tensor cumulants in terms of the 
Boolean cumulants.

<i>Universal Partial Words</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
Given a finite alphabet \(A = \{ 0,1,2,...,a-1 \}\) of size \(a\), a 
<em>word</em> of length \(n\) is a string of \(n\) characters from 
\(A\). A <em>universal word</em> \(w\) is a string of characters from 
\(A\) such that each word of length \(n\) appears exactly once as a 
consecutive substring of \(w\). Universal words are well-studied and 
known to exist for any \(A\) and \(n\). A <em>universal partial 
word</em> is a universal word that can also contain \(\diamond\), which is 
treated as a &quot;wildcard&quot; symbol and may stand in for any character in A. 
Universal partial words are known to exist for binary alphabets and any 
\(n\). In this talk, we will primary consider universal partial words 
over non-binary alphabets, give conditions for non-existence, and will 
provide a construction of the specific case of \(a\) even and \(n=4\).

Pamela Kirkpatrick, Rachel Kirsch, and Ryan Solava. This work was 
partially supported by NSF-DMS grant #1604458, &quot;Rocky Mountain - Great 
Plains Graduate Research Workshops in Combinatorics.&quot;
