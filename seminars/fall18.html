<i>Reconstructing Spheres and Polytopes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We investigate the historical progress of the problem of determining all faces of a sphere from partial information, starting in 1916 through the modern day. As we progress through the results, we will also build up the needed tools to understand their proofs, culminating in a counterexample which disproves the strongest possible version of a conjecture made in 1960. While one conjecture falls, it leaves behind a new technique which may solve the crown jewel of this area, that simplicial spheres are reconstructible from their facet-ridge graph.

<i>An Introduction to Graph Spectra</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> I will wax poetic on the spectra of various matrices associated with graphs. As well, we will briefly discuss cospectrality with respect to certain matrices.

<i>Constructions of distance Laplacian cospectral graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Graphs are mathematical objects that can be embedded into matrices. Two graphs are cospectral if they have the same set of eigenvalues with respect to a matrix. In this talk, we discuss two constructions of cospectral graphs for the distance Laplacian matrix. The first uses vertex twins which have predictable eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the distance Laplacian. The second develops a relaxation of twins called vertex cousins. This second construction produces the only pair of bipartite distance Laplacian cospectral graphs on eight vertices.

<i>Security Games on Matroids</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> We consider a game originally played on graphs that 
easily generalizes to matroids.  The game involves two players called 
Bob and Eve.  Simultaneously Bob chooses a basis of a given matroid and 
Eve chooses a ground set element of the same matroid.  Eve wins if she 
picks an element of Bob's basis otherwise Bob wins.  We consider which 
strategies maximize Bob's chances of winning.  The solution to this was 
shown for the graph case by Gueye, Walrand, and Anantharam in 2011.  In 
2016 a solution to the more general matroid case was given by 
Szeszl&eacute;r.

<i>Modulus on Graphs with a Focus on Spanning Tree Modulus</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> The concept of conformal modulus was originally 
developed in complex analysis, but the construction of discrete modulus 
is quite similar. This talk will focus on the development of the modulus 
of a family of objects on a graph. With the family of spanning trees, it 
will be shown that the 2-Modulus problem is related to a number of other 
interesting problems. For example, through the concept of blocking 
duality, spanning tree modulus is strongly connected to the modulus of a 
transverse family of objects, the feasible partitions. The solution to 
either of these problems immediately yields the solution of the other. 
From a probabilistic viewpoint, spanning tree modulus is related to 
problems involving random spanning trees. Finally, this talk will cover 
a greedy approach to computing spanning tree modulus, and hence gives a 
solution to all of the related problems.

<i>Toric ideals, Gr&ouml;bner bases, and Borel ideals, from a combinatorial perspective</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>We discuss toric ideals, which are non-monomial 
ideals that correspond to the kernel of a natural map between two rings. 
Although these ideals are typically addressed in an algebraic setting, 
we'll approach them combinatorially, showing how certain properties 
(such as having a Gr&ouml;bner basis) is equivalent to a question about a 
family of graphs. We will also apply these techniques to certain Borel 
ideals. This talk will be accessible to graduate students, and I won't 
assume prior knowledge of any of the objects in the title.
