Organizational meeting

<p><strong>Friday 9/3</strong><br>
Mark Denker<br>
<i>Creating and shelling cut complexes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
Given a graph \(G\), we construct a series of simplicial complexes using 
its separating sets called cut complexes.  A result of Fr&ouml;	berg states 
that the 2-cut complex is shellable if and only if \(G\) is chordal, in 
this talk we explain what a simplicial complex is, how we construct the 
\(k\)-cut complex, what it means for a complex to be shellable, and how 
we can understand shellability of the k-cut complex from properties of 
\(G\).

<i>Affine semigroups in commutative algebra</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
An affine semigroup is a set of points inside \(\mathbb{Z}^n\) which is 
closed under addition. These simple but combinatorially rich objects 
also give rise to interesting commutative algebra by assigning points in 
the semigroup to monomials in a ring, typically a subring of a 
polynomial ring over a field. In this example-heavy talk, we will give 
several interesting examples of affine semigroup rings and discuss the 
basics of Hochster's theorem on normality of semigroups.

<p><strong>Friday 9/17</strong><br>
Jeremy Martin<br>
<i>Unbounded matroids</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 A matroid \(M\) on ground set \(E=[n]\) gives rise to a polytope 
\(P\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n\) whose vertices are the characteristic vectors 
of the bases of \(M\).  Each polytope arising in this way is a 
<i>generalized permutahedron</i>: its edges are all parallel to 
differences of standard basis vectors, or equivalently its normal fan 
coarsens the braid fan.  By a theorem of Gel'fand, Goresky, Macpherson 
and Serganova, matroid polytopes are <i>exactly</i> the generalized 
permutahedra whose vertices are all 0,1-vectors.  What can be said about 
0,1-generalized permutahedra that are not assumed to be bounded?  On the 
combinatorial side, these polyhedra correspond to a special case of the 
<i>submodular systems</i> studied by Fujishige and others.  We describe 
the exact correspondence between combinatorial and geometric objects and 
show, for example, that every unbounded matroid has a canonical 
extension to a matroid.

<p><strong>Friday 9/24</strong><br>
Kevin Marshall<br>
<i>A Hopf Monoid On Set Families</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 We study a Hopf monoid <b>SetFam</b> whose underlying objects are 
arbitrary set families, with product given by join and coproduct defined 
by a general notion of restriction and contraction, analogous to that 
for matroids.  Of particular interest is the Hopf submonoid <b>LOI</b>
spanned by families \(J(P)\) of order ideals of finite posets \(P\).  We 
summarize a topological approach, inspired by the work of Aguiar and 
Ardila on generalized permutahedra, for a cancellation-free formula for 
the antipode in <b>LOI</b>.

<p><strong>Friday 10/1</strong><br>
Jennifer Elder (Rockhurst University)<br>
<i>Graphs of Sets of Reduced Words</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> 
 Any permutation in the finite symmetric group can be written as a 
product of adjacent transpositions. For a fixed permutation \(\sigma \in 
\mathfrak{S}_n\) we call products of minimal length reduced words, and 
the collection of all such reduced words is denoted \(R(\sigma)\). Any 
reduced word of \(\sigma\) can be transformed into any other by a 
sequence of commutation moves or long braid moves. We are interested in 
the congruence classes defined by using only braid moves or only 
commutation moves.
 <p>The set \(R(\sigma)\) can be represented as a graph \(G(\sigma)\) 
where the edges denote whether two reduced words are related by a 
commutation relation, or a braid relation. In this talk, we will present 
work on induced subgraphs of \(G(\sigma)\), and how understanding these 
subgraphs will allow us to count the number of edges of a particular 
type in \(G(\sigma)\). We will also discuss how these subgraphs can be 
used to give us a better understanding of the sets of congruence classes 
in \(R(\sigma)\).

<i>Enumerating Triangular and Three-Dimensional Floorplans</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 A triangular floorplan is a subdivision of a triangle into triangular 
rooms. A slicing floorplan is constructed inductively one wall at a 
time. In this talk, I will provide an enumeration of slicing triangular 
floorplans with a specified number of rooms, as well as bijections to 
separable permutation pairs and three-dimensional rectangular 
floorplans.

<p><strong>Friday 10/15</strong><br>
Marge Bayer<br>
<i>Matching Complexes of Planar Graphs</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The matching complex of a graph is a simplicial complex representing 
the matchings (sets of independent edges) of the graph.  Matching 
complexes of certain classes of graphs have been much studied, with an 
array of topological results, particularly on complete graphs and 
complete bipartite graphs.  This talk will focus on matching complexes 
of planar graphs, particularly graphs of certain finite tilings by 
polygons.  This is based on joint work with Julianne Vega and Marija 
Jelic-Milutinovic.

<p><strong>Friday 10/22</strong><br>
Jeremy Martin<br>
<i>Ehrhart theory for paving matroids</i>

<p><strong>Friday 10/29</strong><br>
Andrew Moorhead (EECS)<br>
<i>Introduction to the universal algebra commutator</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 Universal algebra is the study of general algebraic structures, which 
are nonempty sets equipped with some operations. In this talk we will 
give a survey of some main results of the area and then discuss how the 
commutator theories for groups, rings, Lie algebras, and more can be 
viewed as specializations of a general commutator theory applicable to 
any algebraic structure.

<p><strong>Friday 11/5</strong><br>
Matias von Bell (University of Kentucky)<br>
<i>The nu-associahedron via flow polytopes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The nu-associahedron introduced by Ceballos, Pardol, and Sarmiento in 
2019 is a polytopal complex which generalizes the classical 
associahedron. We will first familiarize ourselves with the 
nu-associahedron before introducing the nu-caracol flow polytope. We 
will then show how the nu-associahedron can be obtained as the dual of a 
triangulation of the nu-caracol flow polytope. As a consequence, 
M&eacute;sz&aacute;ros' subdivision algebra can be used to obtain the 
nu-Tamari complex, answering a question of Ceballos, Padrol, and 
Sarmiento. Parts of this talk are based on joint work with Rafael 
Gonz&aacute;les D'Le&oacute;n, Francisco Mayorga Cetina, and Martha Yip.

<p><strong>Friday 11/12</strong><br>
Enrique Salcido<br>
<i>The chromatic symmetric function of a graph</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 The chromatic symmetric function of a graph \(G\) is a proper extension 
of the chromatic polynomial of G that encodes more than the number of 
proper vertex colorings of a graph. We will show multiple ways of 
representing the chromatic symmetric function in terms of different 
bases for the space of symmetric functions and explore what the 
coefficients of these representations encode. One of the representations 
of interest will give the chromatic symmetric function as a sum over the 
broken circuit complex of \(G\).

<p><strong>Friday 11/19</strong><br>
Marge Bayer<br>
<i>Convex Polytopes from a Combinatorial Perspective</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u>
 This is a basic survey talk on the combinatorics of convex polytopes, 
with an emphasis on numbers of faces.  I will discuss a few theorems and 
an open question about 3-dimensional polytopes, and then look at what is 
known and, mostly, not known in higher dimensions.
