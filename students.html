<h3>Former Students</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Dania Morales (PhD, 2024)</b> studied the Ehrhart theory of
lattice path matroid base polytopes.  Her dissertation contains several
fundamental and striking results on these fascinating polytopes: a complete description
of them in terms of linear inequalities, decomposition results that refine
those given by Bidkhori and others, a calculation of their Ehrhart polynomials
in terms of ribbon-shape lattice path matroid polytopes.
and a proof of positivity of their \(h^*\)-vectors by constructing a unimodular triangulation
and shelling it.  Dania is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Willamette University in Salem, OR.
</ul>

<li><b>Enrique Salcido (MA, 2023)</b> studied chromatic symmetric 
functions of trees, in particular Stanley's notorious question of 
whether two non-isomorphic trees can have the same chromatic symmetric 
function (which I consider a major open problem in the area).  Enrique 
is now working for NSA.

<li><b>Kevin Marshall (PhD, 2022)</b> studied Hopf monoids.  Kevin's dissertation <i>Hopf Monoids of Set Families</i> 
constructed a commutative Hopf structure on a very large species: set families \(\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^I\), subject only to the
requirement \(\emptyset\in\mathcal{F}\).  The Hopf structure is inspired by operations on 
antimatroids and admits a nice antipode formula when \(\mathcal{F}\) is the family of order ideals
of a poset on \(I\).  Kevin is working as a software engineer at Epic Systems in Madison, WI.

<li><b><a href="https://math.as.uky.edu/users/jrbe280">Jonah Berggren</a> (BS with honors, 2021)</b> studied a 
generalization of matroids that arose in a project of mine with Federico Castillo and Jos&eacute; Samper.  
Every matroid corresponds to a polytope with every edge parallel to a difference of standard basis vectors 
(<i>generalized permutahedra</i>) and every vertex a 0,1-vector.  If you change &quot;polytope&quot; to 
&quot;polyhedron&quot; (removing the requirements of boundedness), you get <i>unbounded matroids</i>.  The 
project resulted in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02040">joint paper</a> between Jonah, Jos&eacute;, 
and myself.  Jonah is currently a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Kentucky.

<li><b>Emma Colaric (MA, 2020)</b> studied a paper of Felix Breuer and Caroline Klivans on the connections 
between scheduling problems and Ehrhart theory.  Emma is a data scientist at SelectQuote Insurance in Kansas 
City, MO.

<li><b><a href="http://people.ku.edu/~c185d473/">Ken Duna</a> (PhD, 2019)</b> studied matroid independence 
polytopes, which are trickier objects than their better known relations, matroid basis complexes.  Ken's 
dissertation <i>Matroid Independence Polytopes and Their Ehrhart Theory</i> contains a complete characterization 
of their 2-skeletons; very explicit equations for the special case of independence polytopes of shifted matroids; 
and Ehrhart polynomials for the very very special case of uniform matroids.  Among other things, the complex 
zeros of these polynomials exhibit extremely beautiful geometry.  Ken is teaching high school mathematics
in Cloverdale, CA.

<li><b><a href="https://math.washington.edu/people/bennet-goeckner">Bennet Goeckner</a> (Ph.D., 2018)</b> studied 
the structure of simplicial complexes. Bennet, Art Duval, Caroline Klivans and I <a 
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04279">constructed a nonpartitionable Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex</a>, 
disproving a long-standing conjecture of Richard Stanley.  Bennet's dissertation <i>Decompositions of Simplicial 
Complexes</i> studied related problems, including Stanley's conjecture that a \(k\)-acyclic complex decomposes 
into boolean intervals of rank \(k\) and my own (unpublished) conjecture that the Duval-Zhang decomposition of a 
CM complex into boolean trees should admit a balanced version. Bennet was a postdoc at the University of Washington
and is now an assistant professor at the University of San Diego.

<li><b>Joseph Cummings (BS with honors, 2016)</b> studied the Athanasiadis-Linusson bijection 
between parking functions and Shi arrangement regions.  Joe received his PhD from Kentucky in 2022 and is now
a postdoc at Notre Dame.

<li><b>Robert Winslow (BS with honors, 2016)</b> studied matroids and combinatorial rigidity theory.

<li><b><a href="http://www.math.miami.edu/~alazar/">Alex Lazar</a> (MA, 2014)</b>
studied <i>tropical simplicial complexes</i>, which
were introduced by Dustin Cartwright in <a
href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3813">this paper</a>.  In his thesis,
<i>Tropical simplicial complexes and the tropical Picard group</i>,
Alex proved a conjecture of Cartwright on tropical Picard groups (which 
somewhat resemble critical groups of cell complexes) and eventually published his
work as an article in the <a href="combinatorics.org">Electronic Journal of Combinatorics.</a>
Alex went on to earn a PhD at the University of Miami.

<li><b>Keeler Russell (Undergraduate Honors Research Project, 2012-2013)</b>
studied a difficult problem proposed by Stanley: do there exist two nonisomorphic trees with the 
same chromatic symmetric function?  Li-Yang Tan had previously ruled out a counterexample on \(n\leq 23\) 
vertices, using a brute-force search.  Keeler developed parallelized C++ code to perform another 
brute-force search that ruled out a counterexample for \(n\leq 25\), thus reproducing and extending Tan's 
results.  On the KU Mathematics Department's high-performance computing system, the \(n=25\) case (about 
100 million trees) took about 90 minutes using 30 cores in parallel.  Keeler's fully documented code (in C++)
is freely available from <a href="https://github.com/keeler/csf/tree/master/cpp_code">GitHub</a>
or from <a href="CSF/">my website</a>.

<li><b>Brandon Humpert (PhD, 2011)</b>
started by inventing a neat <a 
href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v18i1p31">quasisymmetric analogue of 
Stanley's chromatic symmetric function</a>.  This project morphed into a study of the incidence Hopf 
algebra of graphs; Schmitt had given a general formula for the antipode on an incidence Hopf algebra, but 
Brandon came up with a much more efficient (i.e., cancellation-free) formula for this particular Hopf 
algebra, which became the core result of <a href="pubs.html#hopf">this joint paper</a> and his dissertation
<i>Polynomials associated with graph coloring and orientations</i>.

<li><b>Tom Enkosky (PhD, 2011)</b> tackled the problem of extending my theory of graph varieties to higher 
dimemsion.  Briefly, fix a graph \(G=(V,E)\) and consider the variety \(X^d(G)\) of all &quot;embeddings&quot; of 
\(G\) in \(\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^d\) - i.e., arrangements of points and lines that correspond to the vertices and 
edges of \(G\) and satisfy containment conditions corresponding to incidence in \(G\) - how does the 
combinatorial structure of \(G\) control the geometry of this variety?  In a <a href="pubs.html#GHGV">joint 
paper</a>, Tom and I figured out some answers to the question, including the component structure of \(X^d(G)\).  
Separately, Tom proved a striking <a 
href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v18i1p3">enumerative result</a> about the 
numner of pictures of the complete graph over the finite field of order 2. Tom's dissertation was entitled 
<i>Enumerative and algebraic aspects of slope varieties</i>.

<li><b>Jonathan Hemphill (MA, 2011)</b> studied the \(A^*\) algorithm, which is a heuristic version of the 
Dijkstra's classical algorithm for finding shortest paths in graphs.

<li><b><a 
href="https://education.utexas.edu/departments/curriculum-instruction/graduate-programs/stem-education/stem-education-alumni/jenny-buontempo"> 
Jenny Buontempo (MA, 2008)</a></b> studied matroid theory and the Tutte polynomial.  Jenny went on to earn a PhD in 
STEM Education at the University of Texas.
