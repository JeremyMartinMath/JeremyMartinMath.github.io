  <u>Abstract</u>:
A matroid base polytope is a polytope in which each vertex has 0,1 
coordinates and each edge is parallel to a difference of two coordinate 
vectors.  Matroid base polytopes are described combinatorially by 
integral submodular functions on a boolean lattice, satisfying the unit 
increase property.  We define a more general class of <i>unbounded 
matroids</i>, or <i>U-matroids</i>, by replacing the boolean lattice with 
an arbitrary distributive lattice.  U-matroids thus serve as a 
combinatorial model for polyhedra that satisfy the vertex and edge 
conditions of matroid base polytopes, but may be unbounded.  Like 
polymatroids, U-matroids generalize matroids and arise as a special case 
of submodular systems.  We prove that every U-matroid admits a canonical 
largest extension to a matroid, which we call the <i>generous 
extension</i>; the analogous geometric statement is that every U-matroid 
base polyhedron contains a unique largest matroid base polytope.  We 
show that the supports of vertices of a U-matroid base polyhedron span a 
shellable simplicial complex, and we characterize U-matroid basis 
systems in terms of shelling orders, generalizing Bj&ouml;rner's and Gale's 
criteria for a simplicial complex to be a matroid independence complex.  
Finally, we present an application of our theory to subspace 
arrangements and show that the generous extension has a natural 
geometric interpretation in this setting.

<strong>Hopf monoids of set families</strong>
  (with Kevin Marshall)
<br>Preprint.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
A <i>grounded set family</i> on \(I\) is a subset 
\(\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^I\) such that \(\emptyset\in\mathcal{F}\).  We 
study a linearized Hopf monoid <b>SF</b> on grounded set families, with 
restriction and contraction inspired by the corresponding operations for 
antimatroids.  Many known combinatorial species, including simplicial 
complexes and matroids, form Hopf submonoids of <b>SF</b>, although not 
always with the &quot;standard&quot; Hopf structure (for example, our 
contraction operation is not the usual contraction of matroids).  We use 
the topological methods of Aguiar and Ardila to obtain a 
cancellation-free antipode formula for the Hopf submonoid of lattices of 
order ideals of finite posets.  Furthermore, we prove that the Hopf 
algebra of lattices of order ideals of chain gangs extends the Hopf 
algebra of symmetric functions, and that its character group extends the 
group of formal power series in one variable with constant term 1 under 
multiplication.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Stanley asked whether a tree is determined up to isomorphism by its chromatic symmetric function.
We approach Stanley's problem by studying the relationship between the chromatic symmetric function and other invariants.
First, we prove Crew's conjecture that the chromatic symmetric function of a tree determines its generalized degree sequence, which enumerates vertex subsets by cardinality and the numbers of internal and external edges.
Second, we prove that the restriction of the generalized degree sequence to subtrees contains exactly the same information as the subtree polynomial, which enumerates subtrees by cardinality and number of leaves.  
Third, we construct arbitrarily large families of trees sharing the same subtree polynomial, proving and generalizing a conjecture of Eisenstat and Gordon.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
A graph can be regarded as an electrical network in which each edge is a 
resistor.  This point of view relates combinatorial quantities, such as 
the number of spanning trees, to electrical ones such as effective 
resistance.  The second and third authors have extended the 
combinatorics/electricity analogy to higher dimension and expressed the 
simplicial analogue of effective resistance as a ratio of weighted tree 
enumerators.  In this paper, we first use that ratio to prove a new 
enumeration formula for color-shifted complexes, confirming a conjecture 
by Aalipour and the first author, and generalizing a result of Ehrenborg 
and van Willigenburg on Ferrers graphs.  We then use the same technique 
to recover an enumeration formula for shifted complexes, first proved by 
Klivans and the first and fourth authors.  In each case, we add facets 
one at a time, and give explicit expressions for simplicial effective 
resistances of added facets by constructing high-dimensional analogues 
of currents and voltages (respectively homological cycles and 
cohomological cycles).

  <u>Abstract</u>:
We study pure ordered simplicial complexes (i.e., simplicial complexes 
with a linear order on their ground sets) from the Hopf-theoretic point 
of view. We define a <em>Hopf class</em> to be a family of pure ordered 
simplicial complexes that give rise to a Hopf monoid under join and 
deletion/contraction. The prototypical Hopf class is the family of 
ordered matroids.  The idea of a Hopf class allows us to give a 
systematic study of simplicial complexes related to matroids, including 
shifted complexes, broken-circuit complexes, and <em>unbounded 
matroids</em> (which arise from unbounded generalized permutohedra with 0/1 
coordinates).

We compute the antipodes in two cases: <em>facet-initial complexes</em> 
(a much larger class than shifted complexes) and unbounded ordered 
matroids.  In the latter case, we embed the Hopf monoid of ordered 
matroids into the Hopf monoid of ordered generalized permutohedra, 
enabling us to compute the antipode using the topological method of 
Aguiar and Ardila.  The calculation is complicated by the appearance of 
certain auxiliary simplicial complexes that we call <em>Scrope 
complexes</em>, whose Euler characteristics control certain coefficients of 
the antipode.  The resulting antipode formula is multiplicity-free and 
cancellation-free.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
We show that the base polytope \(P_M\) of any paving matroid \(M\) can be obtained from a hypersimplex by slicing off 
subpolytopes. The pieces removed are base polytopes of lattice path matroids corresponding to panhandle-shaped 
Ferrers diagrams, whose Ehrhart polynomials we can calculate explicitly. Consequently, we can write down the 
Ehrhart polynomial of \(P_M\), starting with Katzman's formula for the Ehrhart polynomial of a hypersimplex. The 
method builds on and generalizes Ferroni's work on sparse paving matroids. Combinatorially, our construction 
corresponds to constructing a uniform matroid from a paving matroid by iterating the operation of 
stressed-hyperplane relaxation introduced by Ferroni, Nasr, and Vecchi, which generalizes the standard 
matroid-theoretic notion of circuit-hyperplane relaxation. We present evidence that panhandle matroids are 
Ehrhart positive and describe a conjectured combinatorial formula involving chain gangs and Eulerian numbers from 
which Ehrhart positivity of panhandle matroids will follow. As an application of the main result, we calculate 
the Ehrhart polynomials of matroids associated with Steiner systems and finite projective planes, and show that 
they depend only on their design-theoretic parameters: for example, while projective planes of the same order 
need not have isomorphic matroids, their base polytopes must be Ehrhart equivalent.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Interval parking functions (IPFs) are a generalization of ordinary parking functions in which 
each car is willing to park only in a fixed interval of spaces.  Each interval parking function 
can be expressed as a pair \((a,b)\), where \(a\) is a parking function and \(b\) is a dual parking 
function.  We say that a pair of permutations \((x,y)\) is <em>reachable</em> if there is an IPF 
\((a,b)\) such that \(x,y\) are the outcomes of \(a,b\), respectively, as parking functions. 
Reachability is reflexive and antisymmetric, but not in general transitive.  We prove that its 
transitive closure, the <em>pseudoreachability order</em>, is precisely the bubble-sort order on 
the symmetric group \(\mathfrak{S}_n\), which can be expressed in terms of the normal form of a 
permutation in the sense of du~Cloux; in particular, it is isomorphic to the product of chains 
of lengths \(2,\dots,n\).  It is thus seen to be a special case of Armstrong's sorting order, 
which lies between the Bruhat and (left) weak orders.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Veit Elser proposed a random graph model for percolation in which 
physical dimension appears as a parameter. Studying this model 
combinatorially leads naturally to the consideration of numerical graph 
invariants which we call <i>Elser numbers</i> \(\mathsf{els}_k(G)\), 
where \(G\) is a connected graph and k a nonnegative integer. Elser had 
proven that \(\mathsf{els}_1(G)=0\) for all \(G\). By interpreting the 
Elser numbers as Euler characteristics of appropriate simplicial 
complexes called <i>nucleus complexes</i>, we prove that for all graphs 
\(G\), they are nonpositive when \(k=0\) and nonnegative for \(k\geq2\). 
The last result confirms a conjecture of Elser. Furthermore, we give 
necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the 2-connected 
structure of \(G\) for the nonvanishing of the Elser numbers.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Given a strictly increasing sequence \(\mathbf{t}\) with entries from 
\([n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}\), a <em>parking completion</em> is a sequence 
\(\mathbf{c}\) with \(|\mathbf{t}|+|\mathbf{c}|=n\) and \(|\{t\in 
\mathbf{t}\mid t\le i\}|+|\{c\in \mathbf{c}\mid c\le i\}|\ge i\) for all 
\(i\) in \([n]\).  We can think of \(\mathbf{t}\) as a list of spots 
already taken in a street with \(n\) parking spots and \(\mathbf{c}\) as 
a list of parking preferences where the \(i\)-th car attempts to park in 
the \(c_i\)-th spot and if not available then proceeds up the street to 
find the next available spot, if any.  A parking completion corresponds 
to a set of preferences \(\mathbf{c}\) where all cars park.
We relate parking completions to enumerating restricted lattice paths 
and give formulas for both the ordered and unordered variations of the 
problem by use of a pair of operations termed <b>Join</b> and 
<b>Split</b>.  Our results give a new volume formula for most 
Pitman-Stanley polytopes, and enumerate the <em>signature parking

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Let \(G\) be a graph with vertex set \(\{1,\dots,n\}\).  A spanning forest \(F\) of \(G\) is {\em increasing} if the sequence of labels on any path 
starting at the minimum vertex of a tree of \(F\) forms an increasing sequence.  Hallam and Sagan showed that the generating function 
\(\textrm{ISF}(G,t)\) for increasing spanning forests of \(G\) has all nonpositive integral roots.  Furthermore they proved that, up to a change of 
sign, this polynomial equals the chromatic polynomial of \(G\) precisely when \(1,\dots,n\) is a perfect elimination order for \(G\).  We give 
new, purely combinatorial proofs of these results which permit us to generalize them in several ways. For example, we are able to bound the 
coefficients of \(\textrm{ISF}(G,t)\) using broken circuits.  We are also able to extend these results to simplicial complexes using the new notion of 
a cage-free complex.  A generalization to labeled multigraphs is also given.  
We observe that the definition of an increasing spanning forest can be formulated in terms of pattern
avoidance, and we end by exploring spanning forests that avoid the
patterns 231, 312 and 321.

We study oscillations in the eigenfunctions for a fractional Schr&ouml;dinger operator on the real line. An argument in the spirit of Courant's nodal domain theorem applies to an associated local problem in the upper half plane and provides a bound on the number of nodal domains for the extensions of the eigenfunctions. Using the combinatorial properties of noncrossing partitions, we turn the nodal domain bound into an estimate for the number of sign changes in the eigenfunctions.

<dd>
  <u>Abstract</u>:
Much information about a graph can be obtained by studying its spanning trees. On the other hand, a graph can be regarded as a 1-dimensional cell complex, raising the question of developing a theory of trees in higher dimension. As observed first by Bolker, Kalai and Adin, and more recently by numerous authors, the fundamental topological properties of a tree --- namely acyclicity and connectedness --- can be generalized to arbitrary dimension as the vanishing of certain cellular homology groups. This point of view is consistent with the matroid-theoretic approach to graphs, and yields higher-dimensional analogues of classical enumerative results including Cayley's formula and the matrix-tree theorem. A subtlety of the higher-dimensional case is that enumeration must account for the possibility of torsion homology in trees, which is always trivial for graphs. Cellular trees are the starting point for further high-dimensional extensions of concepts from algebraic graph theory including the critical group, cut and flow spaces, and discrete dynamical systems such as the abelian sandpile model.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
The pseudodeterminant \(\textrm{pdet}(M)\) of a square matrix is the last nonzero coefficient in its characteristic polynomial; for a nonsingular matrix, this is just the determinant.  If \(\partial\) is a symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix then \(\textrm{pdet}(\partial\partial^t)=\textrm{pdet}(\partial)^2\).  Whenever \(\partial\) is the \(k^{th}\) boundary map of a self-dual CW-complex \(X\), this linear-algebraic identity implies that the torsion-weighted generating function for cellular \(k\)-trees in \(X\) is a perfect square.  In the case that \(X\) is an <i>antipodally</i> self-dual CW-sphere of odd dimension, the pseudodeterminant of its \(k\)th cellular boundary map can be interpreted directly as a torsion-weighted generating function both for \(k\)-trees and for \((k-1)\)-trees, complementing the analogous result for even-dimensional spheres given by the second author.  The argument relies on the topological fact that any self-dual even-dimensional CW-ball can be oriented so that its middle boundary map is skew-symmetric.

  The <i>simplicial rook graph</i> \(SR(d,n)\) is the graph whose vertices
  are the lattice points in the \(n\)th dilate of the standard simplex in
  \(\mathbb{R}^d\), with two vertices adjacent if they differ in exactly
  two coordinates. We prove that the adjacency and Laplacian matrices of
  \(SR(3,n)\) have integral spectrum for every \(n\). The proof proceeds by
  calculating an explicit eigenbasis. We conjecture that \(SR(d,n)\) is
  integral for all \(d\) and \(n\), and present evidence in support of this
  conjecture. For \(n<\binom{d}{2}\), the evidence indicates that the
  smallest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix is \(-n\), and that the
  corresponding eigenspace has dimension given by the Mahonian numbers,
  which enumerate permutations by number of inversions.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
Despite the prominence of &quot;tree-thinking&quot; among contemporary systematists and evolutionary biologists, the biological meaning of different mathematical representations of phylogenies may still be muddled. We compare two basic kinds of discrete mathematical models used to portray phylogenetic relationships among species and higher taxa: stem-based trees and node-based trees. Each model is a tree in the sense that is commonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the biological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Stem-based and node-based trees carry exactly the same information and the biological interpretation of each is similar. Translation between these two kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm, which we provide. With the mathematical representation of stem-based and node-based trees clarified, we argue for a distinction between types of trees and types of names. Node-based and stem-based trees contain exactly the same information for naming clades. However, evolutionary concepts, such as monophyly, are represented as different mathematical substructures in the two models. For a given stem-based tree, one should employ stem-based names, whereas for a given node-based tree, one should use node-based names, but applying a node-based name to a stem-based tree is not logical because node-based names cannot exist on a stem-based tree and visa versa. Authors might use node-based and stem-based concepts of monophyly for the same representation of a phylogeny, yet, if so, they must recognize that such a representation differs from the graphical models used for computing in phylogenetic systematics.

    We generalize the definition and enumeration of spanning trees from the

    the Matrix-Tree Theorem that counts simplicial spanning trees, weighted by the
    squares of the orders of their top-dimensional integral homology groups, in
    terms of the Laplacian matrix of \(\Delta\). As in the graphic case, one can
    obtain a more finely weighted generating function for simplicial spanning trees
    by assigning an indeterminate to each vertex of \(\Delta\) and replacing the
    entries of the Laplacian with Laurent monomials. When \(\Delta\) is a shifted
    complex, we give a combinatorial interpretation of the eigenvalues of its
    weighted Laplacian and prove that they determine its set of faces uniquely,
    generalizing known results about threshold graphs and unweighted Laplacian
    eigenvalues of shifted complexes.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
    Let \( T \) be an unrooted tree. The <i>chromatic symmetric function</i> 
    \( X_T \), introduced by Stanley, is a sum of monomial symmetric
    functions corresponding to proper colorings of \( T \).  The <i>subtree polynomial</i>
    \( S_T \), first considered under a different name by Chaudhary and 
    Gordon, is the bivariate generating function for subtrees of \( T \) by their numbers of 
    edges and leaves. We prove that \( S_T = \langle\Phi,X_T\rangle \), where
    \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle\) is the Hall inner 
    product on symmetric functions and \(\Phi\) is a certain symmetric function that does not 
    depend on \(T\).  Thus the chromatic symmetric function is a stronger isomorphism 
    invariant than the subtree polynomial. As a corollary, the path and degree sequences of a 
    tree can be obtained from its chromatic symmetric function.  As another application, we 
    exhibit two infinite families of trees (<i>spiders</i> and some <i>caterpillars</i>), and 
    one family of unicyclic graphs (<i>squids</i>) whose members are 
    determined completely by their chromatic symmetric functions.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
    Combinatorial rigidity theory seeks to describe the rigidity or flexibility of
    bar-joint frameworks in \(\mathbb{R}^d\) in terms of the structure of the 
    underlying graph \(G\).  The goal of this article is to broaden the foundations of
    combinatorial rigidity theory by replacing \(G\) with an arbitrary representable
    matroid \(M\).  Many of the constructions of
    rigidity theory, including the notions of rigidity independence and parallel
    independence, as well as Laman's and Recski's combinatorial characterizations
    of 2-dimensional rigidity, can naturally be extended to this wider setting.
    As we explain, many of these fundamental concepts really depend only
    on the matroid associated with \(G\) (or its Tutte polynomial), and
    have little to do with the special nature of graphic matroids or the field \(\mathbb{R}\)
    Our main result is a ``nesting theorem'' relating the various
    kinds of independence.
    Immediate corollaries include generalizations of Laman's Theorem, as well as
    the duality between 2-rigidity and 2-parallel independence.
    A key tool in our study is the <i>photo space</i> of \(M\),
    a natural algebraic variety whose irreducibility
    is closely related to the notions of rigidity
    independence and parallel independence.
    The number of points on this variety, when working over a finite 
    field, turns out to be an interesting Tutte polynomial evaluation.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
    The <i>unit ball random geometric graph</i> \(G=G^d_p(\lambda,n)\) has as its vertices
    \(n\) points distributed independently and uniformly in the unit ball in 
    \(\mathbb{R}^d\) with two vertices adjacent if and only if their 
    \(\ell_p\)-distance is at most \(\lambda\). Like its cousin the
    Erd&ouml;s-R&eacute;nyi random graph, \(G\) has a <i>connectivity
    threshold</i>: an asymptotic value for \(\lambda\) in terms of \(n\),
    above which \(G\) is connected and below which \(G\) is disconnected
    (and in fact has isolated vertices in most cases). In the disconnected zone,
    we discuss the number of isolated vertices. In the connected zone, we determine
    upper and lower bounds for the graph diameter of \(G\).  We employ a
    combination of methods from probabilistic combinatorics and stochastic geometry.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
    K. Ding studied a class of Schubert varieties \(X_\lambda\) in type A 
    partial flag manifolds, corresponding to integer partitions 
    \(\lambda\).  He observed that the Schubert cell structure of 
    \(X_\lambda\) is indexed by maximal rook placements on the Ferrers 
    board \(B_\lambda\), and that the integral cohomology groups 
    \(H^*(X_\lambda;\mathbb{Z})\) and \(H^*(X_\mu;\mathbb{Z})\), 
    are additively isomorphic exactly when the Ferrers boards 
    \(B_\lambda\), \(B_\mu\)
    satisfy the combinatorial condition of
    <i>rook-equivalence</i>. We classify the varieties <i>X<sub>&lambda;</sub></i>
    up to isomorphism, distinguishing them by their graded cohomology rings with 
    integer coefficients.  The crux of our approach is studying the 
    nilpotence orders of linear forms in the cohomology ring.

  <u>Abstract</u>:
    Two naturally occurring matroids representable over \(\mathbb{Q}\) are shown 
    to be dual: the <i>cyclotomic matroid</i> represented by the \(n\)th
    roots of unity inside the cyclotomic extension \(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)\)
    and a direct sum of copies of a certain simplicial matroid, considered 
    originally by Bolker in the context of transportation polytopes.  A 
    result of Adin leads to an upper bound for the number of \(\mathbb{Q}\)-bases 
    for \(\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)\) among the \(n\)th roots of unity, which is 
    tight if and only if \(n\) has at most two odd prime factors.  In 
    addition, we study the Tutte polynomial of the cyclotomic matroid in the 
    case that \(n\) has two prime factors.

  <u>Abstract</u>: 
  Let \(m_{12},m_{13},\dots,m_{n-1,n}\) be the slopes of the \(\binom{n}{2}\)
    lines connecting \(n\) points in general position in the 
    plane.  The ideal \(I_n\) of all algebraic relations among 
    the \(m_{ij}\) defines a configuration space called the 
    <i>slope variety of the complete graph</i>.  We prove that 
    \(I_n\) is reduced and Cohen-Macaulay, give an explicit 
    Gr&ouml;bner basis for it, and compute its Hilbert series 
    combinatorially.  We proceed chiefly by studying the associated 
    Stanley-Reisner simplicial complex, which has an intricate recursive 
    structure.  In addition, we are able to answer many questions about the 
    geometry of the slope variety by translating them into purely 
    combinatorial problems concerning enumeration of trees.

<u>Abstract</u>: 
  A <i>picture</i> <strong>P</strong> of a graph <i>G</i> = (<i>V</i>,<i>E</i>) 
  consists of a point <strong>P</strong>(<i>v</i>) for each vertex <i>v</i> in 
  <i>V</i> and a line <strong>P</strong>(<i>e</i>) for each edge <i>e</i> in 
  <i>E</i>, all lying in the projective plane over a field <i>k</i> and
  subject to containment conditions corresponding to incidence in 
  <i>G</i>.  A <i>graph variety</i> is an algebraic set whose points 
  parametrize pictures of <i>G</i>.  We consider three kinds of graph 
  varieties: the <i>picture space</i> <i>X</i>(<i>G</i>) of all pictures;
  the <i>picture variety</i> <i>V</i>(<i>G</i>), an irreducible component 
  of <i>X</i>(<i>G</i>) of dimension 2|<i>V</i>|, defined as the closure 
  of the set of pictures on which all the <strong>P</strong>(<i>v</i>) are distinct; 
  and the <i>slope variety</i> <i>S</i>(<i>G</i>), obtained by forgetting 
  all data except the slopes of the lines <strong>P</strong>(<i>e</i>). We use 
  combinatorial techniques (in particular, the theory of <i>combinatorial 
  rigidity</i>) to obtain the following geometric and algebraic 
  information on these varieties:
  <ol>
    <li>A description and combinatorial interpretation of equations 
        defining each variety set-theoretically.
    <li>A description of the irreducible components of <i>X</i>(<i>G</i>).
    <li>A proof that <i>V</i>(<i>G</i>) and <i>S</i>(<i>G</i>) are 
        Cohen-Macaulay when <i>G</i> satisfies a sparsity condition, 
        <i>rigidity independence</i>.
  </ol>
  In addition, our techniques yield a new proof of the equality of two 
  matroids studied in rigidity theory.

  Ruling out (160,54,18) difference sets in some nonabelian groups

<u>Abstract</u>:
  We prove the following theorems.
  <ul>
  <li>Theorem A. Let G be a group of order 160 satisfying one of the 
      following conditions.
    (1) G has an image isomorphic to D<sub>20</sub> x Z<sub>2</sub> (for 
        example, if G = D<sub>20</sub> x K).
    (2) G has a normal 5-Sylow subgroup and an elementary abelian 2-Sylow 
        subgroup.
    (3) G has an abelian image of exponent 2, 4, 5, or 10 and order 
        greater than 20. 
    Then G cannot contain a (160,54,18)  difference set.
  <li>Theorem B. Suppose G is a nonabelian group with 2-Sylow subgroup S 
      and 5-Sylow subgroup T and contains a (160,54,18) difference set. 
      Then we have one of three possibilities.
    (1) T is normal, |&phi;(S)| = 8, and one of the following is true:
      (a) G = S x T and S is nonabelian;
      (b) G has a D<sub>10</sub> image; or
      (c) G has a Frobenius image of order 20.
    (2) G has a Frobenius image of order 80.
    (3) G is of index 6 in AGL(1,16).
  </ul>
  To prove the first case of Theorem A, we find the possible distribution 
  of a putative difference set with the stipulated parameters among the 
  cosets of a normal subgroup using irreducible representations of the 
  quotient; we show that no such distribution is possible.  The other two 
  cases are due to others.  In the second case (due to Pott) irreducible
  representations of the elementary abelian quotient of order 32 give a 
  contradiction. In the third case (due to an anonymous referee), the 
  contradiction derives from a theorem of Lander together with Dillon's 
  "dihedral trick." Theorem B summarizes the open nonabelian cases
  based on this work.

<u>Summary</u>:
  Conway proposed an unusual method of constructing the Mathieu group 
  <i>M</i><sub>12</sub>, which has a natural extension to a "quasigroup" 
  named <i>M</i><sub>13</sub>.  We verify Conway's construction by 
  combining a code-theoretic argument (due to Elkies) and a computer
  search.  The computer-generated data was useful in examining a metric on
  <i>M</i><sub>13</sub> induced naturally by Conway's construction, and to 
  determine the extent to which <i>M</i><sub>13</sub> extends the 
  quintuply transitive action of <i>M</i><sub>12</sub> to a sextuply 
  transitive action.
