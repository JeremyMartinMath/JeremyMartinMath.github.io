<title>Jeremy L. Martin - Advice for Prospective Graduate 
Students</title>

<h2>Personal Statements</h2>

<p>Nearly all graduate schools will ask you for a personal statement. 
Here are my personal opinions of dos and don'ts for writing
your statement, based on my experience reading these letters.

<p><b>Do</b> describe what you have done as a student, what you like 
about mathematics, and what you want to do with it.

<p><b>Don't</b> evaluate yourself or compare
yourself to other students.  That is your letter-writers' job.

<p><b>Do</b> emphasize your strengths.  For example,
<ul>
<li> research experience (REU, honors thesis, ...)
<li> teaching experience (TA or grader positions, private tutoring, work 
with high-school or younger students, ...)
<li> competition experience (Putnam, Kansas Math Competition, ...)
<li> other academic interests (physics, computer science, ...)
<li> relevant job experience (internship, lab work, ...)
</ul>
are all good qualifications for graduate school.  Write about it, the 
more specifically the better.

<p><b>Don't</b> merely list facts that can be found elsewhere in 
your application (such as your grades; that's what the transcript is 
for).

<p><b>Do</b> be scrupulously 
honest about stating your qualifications and experience.
In particular...


<p><b>Don't</b> write, &quot;I am attracted to Insert Your University
Here because of your world-renowned faculty, outstanding curriculum
and highly unique campus.&quot; This kind of content-free flattery
does not help your application, particularly if it is an obvious
mail-merge. (This is really just a special case of &quot;don't make
stuff up.&quot;)
</ul>
