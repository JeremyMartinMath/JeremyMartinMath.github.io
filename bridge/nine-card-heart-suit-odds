Since Virginia asked yesterday....

The probability of being dealt a nine-card heart suit on any given deal is
about 1 in 11,000.

The probability of being dealt a nine-card heart suit at least once during
a fifty-deal set is a lot bigger:
about 1 in 216.

(By the way, how many deals do you need to play in order for the
probability that you will be dealt a
nine-card heart suit at least once to be 50%?
It turns out that it's about 7500.)

The probability of being dealt *two* nine-card heart suits during fifty
deals is about 1 in 95,000.

It's nice to put mathematics to some practical use. :-)
