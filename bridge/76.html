<h3>My Favorite Hand</h3>

<p>In a 1999 district-level qualifier for what was then the North 
American Open Pairs, I dealt myself the following hand, red on white at 
matchpoints:
<p>
  <img src="s.gif" alt="S"> A K Q J 10 9
  <img src="h.gif" alt="H"> -
  <img src="d.gif" alt="D"> -
  <img src="c.gif" alt="C"> K J 9 8 7 5 3

<P><i>What do you do with this thing?</i> I chose to open 1<img 
src="c.gif" alt="C">. Not 1<img src="s.gif" alt="S">, because I am much 
more interested in partner's club holding than his spades, and certainly 
not 2<img src="c.gif" alt="C">, because I expect a lot of bidding and 
want to get my suits in.
I was not surprised when LHO overcalled 4<img src="h.gif" alt="H">, 
passed back around to me.

<p>I bid 5<img src="h.gif" alt="H">.
That woke everyone up.  LHO asked my partner, Eugene Hung, what that 
meant.  "I have no idea," said Eugene.

<p>After considering, LHO tossed in a double, and Eugene bid 6<img 
src="c.gif" alt="C">. RHO bid 6<img src="h.gif" alt="H">
I passed.  It had to be forcing after my 5<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> bid.
Eugene bid 7<img src="c.gif" alt="C">.

<p>LHO doubled and led the <img src="d.gif" alt="D">A, whereupon Eugene 
tabled
  <img src="s.gif" alt="S"> x x x x
  <img src="h.gif" alt="H"> x x
  <img src="d.gif" alt="D"> x x x
  <img src="c.gif" alt="C"> A Q x x

<p>What a partner! I quickly claimed thirteen tricks for +2330.

<p>This was not quite a top.  Another table conducted a similar auction, 
except that the player with my cards got greedy and redoubled 7<img 
src="c.gif" alt="C">.  The opponents got cold feet and ran to 7<img 
src="h.gif" alt="H">, whereupon my hand bid 7<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> 
--- <i>introducing the suit for the first time at the seven-level</i>.  
This too was doubled and redoubled, and made for +2940 on the 
diamond-ace lead.  However, opening leader could have set 7<img 
src="s.gif" alt="S">-XX by giving his partner a club ruff!  Meanwhile, 
spades broke 2-1, so 7<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> was laydown.
