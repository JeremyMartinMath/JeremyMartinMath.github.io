<a name="#Open"><h3>Summary Of Opening Bids</h3></a>

<ul>
  <li><b>1C:</b> Strong (16+), artificial and forcing
  <li><b>1D:</b> Natural, 11-15, 4+ diamonds, no 5-card major
  <li><b>1H:</b> Natural, 11-15, 5+ hearts or [4414]
  <li><b>1S:</b> Natural, 11-15, 5+ spades
  <li><b>1NT:</b> Natural, 12-15, no 5-card major
  <li><b>2C:</b> Natural, 11-15, 6+ clubs or 5 clubs with a 4-card major; typically unbalanced
  <li><b>2D, 2H, 2S</b>: Bailey Twos
  <li><b>2NT:</b> Natural, 20-21, possible 5-card major
</ul>

<a name="1C"><h3>The 1C Opening</h3>

<p>This bid shows either 16-19 or 22+ balanced, or an unbalanced hand with 16+ HCP or 8+ tricks.  1D is an artificial negative; other responses are mostly natural positives and are forcing to game.  The schedule of responses is as follows:

<ul>
  <li><b>1D:</b> The negative response - 0-8 HCP.  Opener clarifies his strong club via his 
    rebid:

    <ul>
      <li><b>1H,1S,2C,2D</b>: Natural, around 16-21 points, not forcing.  <i>The auction
        proceeds as though that had been the opening bid</i>.
      <li><b>2S,3C,3D</b>: The equivalent of an opening strong two - forcing.  <i>How do we
        show a second negative?</i>
      <li><b>2H</b>: Kokish, forcing responder to bid 2S, after which 2NT is forcing, showing
        24+ balanced, and any other bid shows a strong two in hearts (in particular, 4NT is RKC
        for hearts).
      <li><b>1NT</b>: 16-19 balanced.  <i>Could there be a 5-card major?</i>
      <li><b>2NT</b>: 22-23 balanced.  <i>Could there be a 5-card major?</i>
    </ul>

After the notrump rebids (including the Kokish sequence), we use Puppet Stayman, transfers, and Minor-Suit Stayman.

  <li><b>1H/1S:</b> Natural, 9+ HCP, 5+ cards in bid suit.  Further bidding is natural
    except that a raise to two of the major asks for trump quality, with these responses:
	........................

  <li><b>1NT:</b> 9-14 HCP, balanced.  Thereafter:

    <ul>
      <li><b>2C</b> is something like Crowhurst, asking for information on shape and strength.
        Responses are as follows:

        <ul>
          <li><b>2D</b>: 9-11 HCP, 4 hearts
          <li><b>2H</b>: 9-11 HCP, 4 spades
          <li><b>2S</b>: 9-11 HCP, no 4-card major
          <li><b>2NT</b>: 12-14 HCP, no 4-card major
          <li><b>3C</b>: 12-14 HCP, 4 hearts
          <li><b>3D</b>: 12-14 HCP, 4 spades
        </ul>

      <li><b>2D</b>, <b>2H</b> and <b>2S</b> are natural; <b>2NT</b> shows clubs.
    </ul>

  <li><b>2C/2D:</b> Natural, 9+ HCP, 5+ cards in bid suit
  <li><b>2NT:</b> 15+, balanced

</ul>

<a name="#Open"><h3>General Agreements</h3></a>

<p>As of 2/20/00, this section is basically identical to the corresponding section in the Standard Happy system notes, except that the section on reverses has been deleted

<h3>General Agreements- Uncontested Auctions</h3>

<h4>Fourth Suit Forcing</h4>

<p>A fourth-suit bid is artificial and game-forcing (with one exception; see
below), and expresses doubt about strain.  Opener should make a descriptive
bid, such as rebidding a long suit, bidding NT with a stopper in the fourth
suit, or preference to responder's first suit with three-card support. 
Opener may raise the fourth suit with four cards.</p>

<p>The one exception is the auction 1<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> : 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> :: 1<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> : 1<img src="s.gif" alt="S">.  Opener should treat the 1<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> bid as natural and forcing for one round only.</p>

<h4>Splinters</h4>

<p>Splinters are typically double jump-shifts after an opening bid, promising four-card support, a singleton or void in the suit bid, and game-forcing strength.</p>

<a name="Twooverone"><h4>2/1 Auctions</h4></a>

<p>A 2/1 response by an unpassed hand is game-forcing, with one exception, the auction 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> : 2<img src="c.gif" alt="C">.  Because of the huge number of possible auctions, most of which are fairly natural, we have few specific
agreements but many general rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Responder should keep in mind that opener does not have a balanced
    10-13 HCP (he would have opened 1NT).
  <li> Jumps are picture-bids showing very specific hands- we do not jump
    without a very good reason!  Generally, jumps to game deny any first- or
    second-round controls in unbid suits.  Jumps below game show significant
    extra strength.  Jumps in new suits tend to be splinter raises in partner's
    last bid suit.
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Rebidding your own suit </b> is the catchall bid.  It doesn't promise
    extra length; it just denies any other descriptive bid.  (In the worst-case
    scenario, one might rebid 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> after 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> : 2<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> with [4441] and
    major-suit holdings unsuitable to bid 2NT.)  Thereafter:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Simple raise</b> shows exactly three-card support.
      <li><b>Jump-raise to game </b> denies any controls in unbid suits.
      <li><b>Jump in a new suit </b> is a splinter raise with three-card
        support.
      <li><b>Other bids </b> are natural.
    </ul>

  <li><b>New suit </b> is natural.  If a reverse, it shows extra strength
    (at least a king more than a minimum).  If at the 3-level, it shows two
    good 5-card suits.  Thereafter:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Raise</b> guarantees four cards.
      <li><b>Preference to opener's first suit</b> shows exactly three-card
        support.
      <li><b>Fourth suit</b> may be artificial
    </ul>

  <li><b>2NT</b> shows 14-17 balanced;<b>3NT</b> shows 18-19 balanced.
    Continuations are natural (4<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> is Gerber).
  <li><b>Raise</b> shows primary support- Hxx or xxxx.  Continuations are
    natural.
  <li><b>Jump-rebidding your suit</b> shows a solid suit- the only honor
    you are allowed to lack is the ace (to facilitate counting tricks).  A
    jump to game denies any controls in unbid suits.
  <li><b>Jump raise to game</b> denies any controls in unbid suits.
  <li><b>Jump raise to four of a minor</b> shows extreme distribution.
  <li><b>4NT</b> is straight Blackwood.
</ul>

<a name="contested"><h3>General Agreements- Contested Auctions</h3></a>

<p>The following agreements apply in all auctions where we open one of a suit
and the opponents have the chutzpah to butt in.</p>

<p>In competitive auctions, all jump raises are <b>preemptive</b> and all jump shifts are <b>fit bids</b>, promising four-card support for partner's last bid suit and the values for whatever level the bid is at.</p>

<h4>Opponents Make A Suit Overcall</h4>

<ol>
  <li><b>Jump raises</b> are always preemptive in competition.  Jump shifts are fit-showing
    bids.
  <li><b>Negative Doubles.</b> If the opponents make a suit overcall through 3<img src="s.gif"
    alt="S">, a double by responder is negative, showing 6+ HCP at the one- or two-level and 9+
    at the three-level.  In addition, doubler promises four cards in an unbid major (or 4-4 if
    the overcall was 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D">), or 4-4 in both unbid minors.  As a corollary,
    freely bidding a major over an overcall of 1<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> or higher promises a
    five-card or longer suit. 
  <li><b>Support Doubles.</b> Opener's double of a sandwich suit overcall through 2<img
    src="h.gif" alt="H">, as in the auction 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> (P) 1<img src="h.gif"
    alt="H"> (1<img src="s.gif" alt="S">) : X, shows exactly three-card support for responder's
    suit.  Thus a raise guarantees four trumps and other bids (besides a cue-bid) generally
    deny as many as three.  Support doubles also apply after an overcall, new-suit response,
    and raise, e.g.: 1<img src="d.gif" alt="D">  (1<img src="h.gif" alt="H">) 1<img
    src="s.gif" alt="S"> (2<img src="h.gif" alt="H">) : X.
  <li><b>Cue-bids</b> tend to show at least three-card support for partner's last bid
    or implied suit, and at least limit raise strength.  Jump cue-bids are splinter raises.
  <li><a name="UVU"><b>Unusual vs. Unusual</b></a>.  If the opponents make a two-suited
    overcall, the cheaper cue-bid shows a limit raise or better and the expensive cue-bid is a
    forcing bid in the unbid suit.  As a corollary, a raise shows only single-raise strength
    and bidding the unbid suit is to play.  For instance, after 1<img src="h.gif" alt="H">
    (2NT) [minors],

    <ul>
      <li><b>3<img src="c.gif" alt="C">:</b> Limit raise or better in hearts
      <li><b>3<img src="d.gif" alt="D">:</b> Spades, forcing
      <li><b>3<img src="h.gif" alt="H">:</b> Natural, nonforcing
      <li><b>3<img src="s.gif" alt="S">:</b> Natural, nonforcing
      <li><b>Double:</b> Strength equivalent to a negative double, and at
	  least four cards in one of their suits, starting a
        head-hunting auction.
      <li><b>Pass, then double later:</b> Three trumps
    </ul>

  3NT is always to play.  A jump in one of overcaller's suits is presumably a splinter raise.
</ol>

<h4>Opponents Make A Takeout Double</h4>

<p>If the opponents make a takeout double of our one-of-a-suit opening, we have the following agreements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>New suit at the 1-level</b> is forcing.
  <li><b>New suit at the 2-level</b> is non-forcing.
  <li><b>2NT</b> is Jordan, showing a 4-card limit raise or better.
  <li><b>Redouble of a direct double, or a sandwich double of a 2/1</b> is
    business, showing 10^+ HCP and implying no fit.
  <li><b>Redouble of a sandwich double of a 1/1</b> shows exactly three-card
    support.  (Thus a raise guarantees four trumps and other bids tend to
    deny as many as three.)
</ul>

<a name="1D"><h3>The 1D Opening Bid</h3>

<p>This is natural, showing 11-15 points, 4+ diamonds, and no 5-card major.  Responses are pretty much natural, but there are some gadgets:

<ul>
  <li><b>1H</b> is natural, 4+ hearts, forcing.  Opener's rebids are as follows:

    <ul>
	<li><b>1S:</b> Natural
	<li><b>1NT:</b> Natural, promising 2 or 3 hearts
	<li><b>2C:</b> Natural, with 4-5, 5-4 or longer in the minors
	<li><b>2D:</b> Natural, usually 6+ diamonds
	<li><b>2H:</b> Natural, usually 4 hearts
	<li><b>2S:</b> ??
	<li><b>2NT:</b> Natural, maximum, solid diamond suit and tenaces
	<li><b>3C:</b> ??
	<li><b>3D:</b> Natural, maximum, solid diamond suit and hard values outside
	<li><b>3H:</b> Natural, maximum, 4 hearts for sure
    </ul>

  <li><b>1S</b> is natural, 4+ spades, forcing.  Opener's rebids are as follows:

    <ul>
	<li><b>1NT:</b> Natural, promising 2 or 3 spades
	<li><b>2C:</b> Natural, with 4-5, 5-4 or longer in the minors
	<li><b>2D:</b> Natural, usually 6+ diamonds
	<li><b>2H:</b> 3-trump raise
	<li><b>2S:</b> 4-trump raise
	<li><b>2NT:</b> Natural, maximum, solid diamond suit and tenaces
	<li><b>3C:</b> ??
	<li><b>3D:</b> Natural, maximum, solid diamond suit and hard values outside
	<li><b>3H:</b> Maximum with 3 spades??
	<li><b>3S:</b> Natural, maximum, 4 spades
    </ul>

  <li><b>1NT</b> is natural, 8-9. ????
  <li><b>2D</b> is a forcing raise, 10+ points, 4+ diamonds, no 4-card major.  Continuations???
  <li><b>2M</b> is a Soloway jump-shift.
  <li><b>2NT</b> is invitational, 10-11. ????
  <li><b>3C</b> is ??
  <li><b>3D</b> is preemptive.
  <li><b>3M</b> is a splinter.
  <li><b>3NT</b> is a demand to see what the hell you opened on this time.
</ul>

<a name="Major"><h3>The 1H and 1S Opening Bids</h3>

<p>An opening bid of 1<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> or 1<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> promises a five-card suit 99% of the time.  The only exception is that we open 1H (with fingers crossed) holding [4414].</p>

<ul>
  <li>1S over 1H is the usual: natural and forcing.  A 1NT rebid by opener guarantees two or
    three spades.
  <li>2/1 responses are game forcing.  
  <li><b>1NT</b> is forcing by an unpassed hand, semi-forcing by a passed hand.  Opener should
    rebid descriptively, inventing a three-card minor if need be.  A 2S rebid shows the [4414]
    hand; jump-shifts show two good five-card suits.  Responder's continuations are:

    <ul>
      <li><b>Pass</b> is always an option; however, if opener's rebid was 2<img src="c.gif"
        alt="C"> or 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> then responder should have at least five trumps.
      <li><b>New suit</b> is to play, with one exception: the auction 1<img src="h.gif"
        alt="H"> : 1NT :: 2m : 2<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> cannot be natural, as responder has
        denied four spades.  Therefore, it indicates a good raise of opener's minor, stronger
        than bidding 3m.
      <li><b>Preference to 2M</b> is weak, either a single raise that would
        not accept any game try, or a doubleton trump and a mediocre hand (<10 SP).
      <li><b>2NT</b> is natural and invitational, around 10-12 balanced.
      <li><b>Raise</b> is natural and invitational.
      <li><b>Jump in a new suit</b> is invitational.
      <li><b>Jump preference to 3M</b> is a three-trump limit raise.
      <li><b>3NT</b> is probably a flat 13-14 HCP.
      <li><b>Jump to game</b> implies a hand that improved after hearing opener's rebid.  Or
        perhaps it's a three-card strength with game-forcing strength but lacking controls.
        Whatever.
    </ul>

  <li><b>2M</b> shows three trumps in a semi-balanced or balanced hand (rarely four trumps in a
    flat hand), and about 7-9 SP- a hand that would accept at least one game try.  Opener has a
    number of ways of doing that: 

    <ul>
      <li><b>2M+1</b> is a short-suit game try.  Responder must bid 2M+2,
        whereupon opener bids his singleton: 2M+3 = <img src="c.gif" alt="C">, 2M+3 = <img
        src="d.gif" alt="D">, 3M = other major. 
      <li><b>2M+2, 2M+3, 2M+4</b> are help-suit game tries in clubs,
        diamonds and the other major, respectively.  Responder should upgrade
        honors in the bid suit and tentatively downgrade minor honors in other
        side suits.  <i>KJx is a good example of a help-suit game try; xxx isn't.???</i>.
      <li><b>3M</b> is what they call momma-poppa: "Do you have a maximum?"
    </ul>

  <li><b>2M+1</b> shows four or more trumps and limit raise strength or
    better, at least 10 SP.  Opener's rebids resemble responses to a Jacoby 2NT: 

    <ul>
      <li><b>2M+2, 2M+3, 2M+4</b> show singletons in clubs, diamonds and the
        other major, respectively.
      <li><b>3M</b> shows a minimum hand, one which would not wish to play
        in game opposite a bare limit raise.  Responder, of course, may
        continue with extra strength.
      <li><b>3NT</b> is a general slam try, probably at least 16 SP.
      <li><b>New suit between 3M and 4M</b> is natural, 5-5.
      <li><b>4M</b> is an attempt at signing off.
    </ul>

  <li><b>2M+2</b> is a "mini-splinter": 10-12 SP including a singleton.  This bid can be made
    on three trumps.  Opener's response shows the cheapest singleton opposite which he is
    willing to play in game: 2M+3 = <img src="c.gif" alt="C">, 2M+4 = <img src="d.gif"
    alt="D">, 3M = OM.  After a response of 2M+3, responder can bid 2M+4 with a diamond
    singleton and 3M with a singleton in the other major.

  <li><b>2M+3</b> shows a Soloway jump-shift hand.  Opener should relay with 2M+4, after which

    <ul>
      <li><b>3NT</b> shows a balanced 17-19 HCP
      <li><b>New suit</b> shows a solid suit and sets trumps.  <i>Jumping</i> in a new suit
        denies an outside ace or king.
      <li><b>3M</b> shows four-card support for opener's major (which is set as trumps) and
        an excellent suit of one's own.  Opener now has further machinery to use:

        <ul>
          <li><b>3M+1</b> asks for responder's side suit (3M+2 = <img src="c.gif" alt="C">,
            3M+3 = <img src="d.gif" alt="D">, 3M+4 = OM)
          <li><b>3M+2, 3M+3, 3M+4</b> are Q-bids in clubs, diamonds and the other major,
            respectively
          <li><b>4M</b> shows a hand opener wished he hadn't opened
          <li><b>4NT</b> is RKCB (duh).
        </ul>
    </ul>

  <li><b>2M+4</b> shows either a "game splinter" (13-15 SP including a
    singleton) or a preemptive raise to 3M.  Opener must bid 3M, after which
    responder passes with the preemptive raise or shows his singleton (3M+1 =
    <img src="c.gif" alt="C">, 3M+2 = <img src="d.gif" alt="D">, 3M+3 = OM).
  <li><b>3M</b> shows a mixed raise: four trumps, 7-9 SP.
  <li><b>3NT</b> is Bergen: 13-15 HCP and three trumps in a flat hand.
  <li><b>New suit between 3M and 4M</b> is a "full splinter": 16-18 HCP
    with a singleton in the bid suit.
  <li><b>4M</b> is to play.
  <li><b>4NT</b> asks for aces; it's not RKCB as no suit has been agreed. 
</ul>

<p>In competition, this nonsense is off.  See the <a href="#Contested">competitive bidding section.</a></p>

<p><a href="#Contents"><font size=2>Back to contents</font size></a>
<hr>

<a name="#1NT"><h3>The 1NT Opening Bid</h3></a>

<p>The 1NT opening shows 12-15 HCP and a balanced hand with no five-card major.  Exceptionally, opener may have a singleton king or queen somewhere.</p>

<p>Responses are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>2C:</b> Scrambling Stayman.  Responder might be running from 1NT, or he might have a
    decent hand.  This bid is automatic with 4-4 in the majors.  Opener should bid 4-card suits
    up the line, or bids 2D [?????] with [3334] or (233)5.  The object is to find a seven-card
    or better fit at the two-level.  If opener bids a four-card major, 2NT and 3M are
    invitational (10-11), 4M is drop-dead, and a jump-shift is a splinter.
  <li><b>2D:</b> Game-forcing Stayman, 12+.  Responses are reversed:
    <ul>
	<li><b>2H:</b> Four spades, possibly four hearts
	<li><b>2S:</b> Four hearts, fewer than four spades
	<li><b>2NT:</b> No 4-card major
	<li><b>3C:</b> 5 reasonable clubs, no 4-card major
    </ul>
  <li><b>2M,3m:</b> To play.
  <li><b>2NT:</b> Invitational (10-11).
  <li><b>3M:</b> 5-5 minors with shortness in bid suit.
  <li><b>4C:</b> Gerber.
  <li><b>4D:</b> Pick a major suit game.
</ul>

<a name="#2C"><h3>The 2C Opening Bid</h3></a>

<p>This shows at least 5 clubs; if only 5 clubs are held then opener will also have a four-card major.  The hand is usually unbalanced but presumably could be (332)6 or [42]25 with an aversion to opening 1NT.</p>

<p>Responses are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>2D:</b> Artificial Stayman inquiry.  Opener bids a 4-card major up the line or bids
    2NT or 3C without one, whereupon...??
  <li><b>2M:</b> To play.
  <li><b>2NT:</b> Invitational.
  <li><b>3C:</b> Natural raise.
  <li><b>3D:</b> To play.
  <li><b>3M:</b> Natural, forcing, good 6-card suit
</ul>

<a name="#Preempt"><h3>Preemptive Openings</h3></a>

<h3>Bailey Two-Bids</h3>

<p>An opening bid of 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D">, 2<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> or 2<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> is a<b>Bailey Two</b>- a disciplined weak two promising the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li> 5-6 cards in the bid suit.  If only five, they must be headed by
    the queen or better.
  <li> 2-3 cards in any unbid major.
  <li> 1-4 cards in any unbid minor.
  <li> No more than nine cards in any two suits.
  <li> 8-10 HCP if nine cards in the two longest suits; 9-11 HCP if eight
    cards in the two longest suits.
</ol>

<p>Responder acts as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Non-jump new suits</b> are non-forcing.
  <li><b>Jump shifts below game</b> are natural and game forcing.
  <li><b>Jumps to game</b> are to play.
  <li><b>In an uncontested auction, a raise</b> is invitational (3+ trumps
    and about 15-16 support points).
  <li><b>In a contested auction, a raise</b> is competitive.  However, 
    responder should have roughly a weak notrump so that opener can double
    for penalty if he sees fit (no pun intended).
  <li><b>4NT</b> is plain old Blackwood.
  <li><b>2NT after 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D"></b> is natural and invitational.
  <li><b>2NT after 2<img src="h.gif" alt="H">/<img src="s.gif" alt="S"></b> is artificial and
    asks opener to bid his longer minor (or 3<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> if equal).  The 2NT
    response can be made on several hand types, distinguished by responder's rebid.  Except
    for the first of these, bidding 2NT as a prelude to a game force tends to express some
    doubt about the right strain (compared to, e.g., an immediate jump-shift.)

    <ul>
      <li><b>Pass</b> with a weak minor two-suiter.
      <li><b>New suit</b> is natural and game-forcing.  Opener should support
        if possible, else bid out his shape
      <li><b>3NT</b> expresses doubt about the right game, which generally
        means a doubleton in opener's suit; opener is allowed to correct.
      <li><b>3 of opener's major</b> shows exactly two-card support and is
        forcing.  Opener should bid out his shape.  If responder's third bid is
        4NT, it is RKC for opener's suit.
      <li><b>4NT</b> is natural and invitational to 6NT (about 23 HCP).
    </ul>

</ul>

<h3>Three-Level and Higher Preempts</h3>

<p>All suit openings at the 3- or 4-level, as well as 5<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> and 5<img src="d.gif" alt="D">, are preemptive.  Our preempting style is aggressive and, for the moment, undisciplined.  All we have agreed is that a new suit is forcing.</p>

<h3>The 3NT Opening</h3>

<p>An opening 3NT bid in first, second or third seat promises a long solid
minor, at least AKQ-seventh or AK-eighth, and no stopper outside.  Responses
are defined as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Pass:</b> Three suits stopped
  <li><b>All <img src="c.gif" alt="C"> bids:</b> Pass or correct
  <li><b>4<img src="h.gif" alt="H">/<img src="s.gif" alt="S">:</b> To play
  <li><b>4NT:</b> "Bid a slam with an 8-card suit."
  <li><b>5NT:</b> "Pick a slam."
</ul>

<p>A fourth-seat 3NT opening is to play and is user-defined.</p>

<h3>Suit Overcalls</h3>

<h4>Simple Overcall at the One-Level</h4>

<p>Our one-level overcall style is heavily influenced by Mike Lawrence.  Range is roughly 7-17 non-vulnerable, 9-17 vulnerable.  Most of our overcalls are based on five-card suits (which can be crappy if the rest of the hand qualifies), but we have no problem overcalling on good four-card suits with length in the enemy suit.</p>

<h4>Advancing the Overcall</h4>

<p>Advancer has many options, as the overcall only defines a suit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Pass</b> denies the values to act.
  <li><b>Simple raise</b> is semi-constructive, showing 4^+-10 SP.  We
    strive to raise as often as possible.
  <li><b>Jump raise below game</b> is preemptive.
  <li><b>Jump raise to game</b> is to play; usually preemptive.
  <li><b>New suit</b> is constructive but non-forcing.
  <li><b>Jump in a new suit</b> is fit-showing.  A good hand with a good
    suit lacking support starts with a cuebid.  Double jumps are not
    splinters, but fit-jumps with greater offensive support.
  <li><b>1NT</b> shows 7-11 HCP and usually a stopper in the enemy suit.
  <li><b>2NT</b> is natural and invitational, typically 12-14 HCP and
    a stopper.
  <li><b>3NT</b> is to play.
  <li><b>Cuebid</b> shows either a non-distributional limit raise or a
    hand with opening bid values.
  <li><b>Jump cuebid</b> is a limit raise or better with a singleton or void.
</ul>

<p>In competition, free bids carry the same meaning as if responder had passed.  In addition,</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Double of a raise</b> is responsive, showing values and no
    direction.
  <li><b>Other doubles</b> are for penalties.
  <li><b>Cuebid of a new suit</b> is<b>natural</b>, promising 5 good
    trumps.
  <li><b>Redouble</b> means you like blue better than green.
</ul>

<h4>Rebids by the Overcaller</h4>

<p>The overcaller's rebid varies widely according to advancer's action.  While this section is by no means comprehensive, here are some situations where overcaller's rebid may have hidden implications:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Advancer makes a simple raise:</b> For simplicity, we rebid as 
if overcaller had opened the bidding and opener had overcalled.
Therefore, a new suit is a help-suit game try, etc.

<li><b>Advancer cuebids</b> A simple rebid of the overcalled suit always promises minimum values.  A new suit below the overcalled suit is natural and says nothing
about strength.  All other rebids promise an opening hand and are descriptive.  A cuebid in response to a cue shows a partial stopper (Jxx, Qx) and lets advancer bid NT with another partial stopper. 

<li><b>Advancer jump-cuebids</b> Since a jump cuebid shows a distributional limit raise, returning to three of the trump suit is to play.  If the agreed suit is a minor, a rebid of 3NT is to play.  If the agreed suit is a major, 3NT is a Mathe asking bid: responses show the singleton.  With a spade singleton and hearts agreed, rebid 4<img src="h.gif" alt="H">.

</ul>

<h4>Further Rebids</h4>

Most auctions are straightforward given this framework.  Note if advancer
cuebids and then bids a new suit, this is forcing to the four-level as the
balanced limit-raise cuebids give support at the next turn.  Also, see our
section on forcing passes in competition. 

<h3>Simple Two-Level Overcalls</h3>

All two-level overcalls promise at least 5 cards, probably 6 (especially in a
minor), and a good suit.  A two-level overcall also promises significant
values: 12+ HCP, maybe less with compensating distributional shape.

Advances after a two-level overcall are the same: fit-showing jumps,
invitational-plus cuebids, and new suits non-forcing.  If a new suit is bid
at the three-level, it should be missing at most one top honor and provide at
least six tricks opposite a singleton and good breaks. 

<h3>Jump Overcalls</h3>

Our jump overcalls are weak and slightly aggressive.  We will usually have at
least 6 cards for a single jump overcall and 7 cards for a double jump,
except at favorable, where we will regularly jump overcall with a card less. 
We tend to have our strength in our suit, with at most 1 QT outside. 
Finally, we will strive to be within 2 tricks of our contract vulnerable. 

Jumps to game are to play.  Opposite a passed hand, they may contain
significant outside values and be bidding game as a tactical manuever.
[Melucci's Law: 4<img src="h.gif" alt="H"> is the best preempt in the game.]

<h4>Advancing Jump Overcalls</h4>

Advancer pretends partner made the analogous opening bid and
bids as if opener had not opened except that new suits should be
non-forcing.

<h3>Notrump Overcalls</h3>

Most notrump overcalls over the opponents' one-of-a-suit opening show 
two-suited hands.  The exceptions are notrump overcalls in the balancing 
seat or bids of 3NT.  

<h3>The 1NT Overcall</h3>

Instead of the standard 15-18 balanced, we use a direct 1NT overcall to show
exactly 4 cards in the highest unbid suit and 5 or more cards in the lowest
unbid suit, with less than an opening hand.  With 15-18 balanced, we either
double and rebid NT or pass with length in the enemy suit.

The general principle to remember is that all advances to a suit shown by a
two-suited overcall are to play.  Also, both notrump and the opening suit are
"cuebids".  Cuebid of the opening suit is similar to a cuebid advance of a
simple overcall, while 2NT shows strength (12+ HCP) and demands information
about the shape of opener's hand.

In competition, a double uses the stolen-bid principle and redouble shows
9+ HCP and stoppers.  The ignore-competition principle governs all free
bids. 

For example, after (1<img src="h.gif" alt="H">) : 1NT : (P):

<ul>
  <li><b>All <img src="c.gif" alt="C"> bids:</b> Pass or correct
  <li><b>All <img src="d.gif" alt="D"> bids:</b> Natural
  <li><b>All <img src="s.gif" alt="S"> bids:</b> To play
  <li><b>2<img src="h.gif" alt="H">:</b>  4+ spades, invitational values
  <li><b>2NT:</b> 12+ HCP, asks for opener's size and shape
  <li><b>3<img src="h.gif" alt="H">:</b> Heart splinter, spade support
  <li><b>3NT:</b> To play
</ul>

After (1<img src="h.gif" alt="H">) : 1NT : (2<img src="d.gif" alt="D">):

<ul>
  <li><b>Double:</b> Natural (i.e., "I would have bid 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D">")
  <li><b>Pass:</b> No known fit
  <li><b>Other:</b> As above
</ul>

Most of the time, overcaller passes the rebid, with a few exceptions:

<ul>
  <li><b>After advancer cuebids opener's suit:</b> Rebid the major with a
    minimum.  All other bids show a maximum and are descriptive.  A rebid of
    NT confirms a stopper, denies a void, and offers 3NT as a place to play.
  <li><b>After advancer "raises" notrump:</b> Rebid the minor with a 
    minimum hand.  With a maximum, bid hearts to show clubs or bid spades to
    show diamonds.  Overcaller can also bid 3NT with a semi-balanced maximum
    and a stopper in opener's suit.
</ul>

In competition, "Stolen bid" and "ignore competition" principles apply. 
A redouble shows a maximum and at least a partial stopper.

<h3>Unusual Notrump Overcalls</h3>

We play jump notrump overcalls to 2NT and 4NT over an opponent's
one-of-a-suit bid as unusual, showing the lowest two unbid suits.

The 2NT bid promises 5-5 shape (as we are going to be outbid unless we can
count on partner for 5 cards in each suit) and the 4NT bid 6-6 or better. The
point range is either weak (0-12) or strong (17+).  We also require an
average SQ of 7.5, adjustable based on the vulnerability.

4NT by advancer is straight Blackwood.  A cuebid is a try for game or slam try; overcaller should rebid the cheapest shown suit with a minimum and make any other bid with a maximum.  All other bids are to play.

Advancer is captain of the auction.  After an attempted sign-off, bidding a known suit only promises extra length; weird-sounding actions (cue-bid, further notrump bid, double or redouble) indicate one of the 17+ hands. 

<h3>Balancing NT Overcalls</h3>

In balancing seat, we use a more standard interpretation for 1NT.

<ul>
  <li> After <b>one of a minor</b> has been followed by two passes, 1NT
    shows 11-14, balanced.
  <li> After <b>one of a major</b> has been followed by two passes, 1NT
    shows 11-16, balanced.
</ul>

All advances are natural.  2<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> is clubs, 2NT is invitational.  A jump shift is undefined.

A balancing 2NT overcall is<b>natural</b>, showing 18-20 HCP, unless
the hand is a passed hand, in which case it is for the minors.  All
advances are natural and non-forcing.

In sandwich seat, 1NT shows at least four cards in the unbid suits - usually
(54xx) - and 7-11 HCP.

The meaning of a sandwich 2NT depends on whether a sandwich 1NT overcall is
available.  If it is, then 2NT shows at least 6-5 in the unbid suits with no
specific HCP range.  Otherwise, 2NT in the sandwich seat is unusual for the
lowest two unbid suits, similar to a direct overcall.

Advances after sandwich NT overcalls are similar to those for direct NT
overcalls. 

All overcalls of 3NT over a one-level suit bid, no matter what position, are
to play.  It is overcaller's responsibility to know what he is doing. 
Generally, this shows around 8.5 playing tricks with a stopper in the
enemy suit.  (See the Jump Cuebid below for a corollary situation.) 

Advances are natural and non-forcing, with the exception that 4NT is
Blackwood. 

<h3>Scrambling 2NT</h3>

After the opponents bid and raise a suit, all 2NT bids by the defensive side
are artificial and "scrambling", showing at least four cards in two of the
three unbid suits.  This also applies in response to a takeout double. 
Advancer bids four-card suits up-the-line until a fit is found.  If no fit is
found, then apply Hamilton's Law ("May God help you!").

<h3>Takeout Doubles</h3>

Our takeout doubles are pretty standard, showing either

<ul>

<li> at least a minimum opener and support (three cards or more) for the
unbid suits (we may occasionally cheat on an unbid minor, but not on a
major); or

<li> a one-suited hand too strong to overcall, a balanced 16+, or a monster
hand, with which doubler intends to bid a new suit, bid notrump, or cue-bid
regardless of advancer's bid. 

</ul>

Advancer should assume the first hand-type, as we do below.  He bids as
follows:

<ul>

<li><b>Cheap suit bid</b> shows 0-7 HCP.  Doubler should not continue
without at least an ace more than a minimum.  If responder has not passed,
then this is a free bid and promises about 5-7 HCP and a genuine suit.
<li><b>1NT</b> shows 7-10 HCP and a stopper.
<li><b>Single jump in a suit</b> shows 8-12 HCP.
<li><b>2NT</b> shows 11-12 HCP and a stopper.
<li><b>Cue-bid</b> shows either 13+ HCP, game-forcing, or an invitational
hand with both majors.  The only way to stop below game after a cue-bid is if
doubler rebids 2M and responder raises to three.
<li><b>All double or higher jumps, and all game bids</b> are preemptive, to
play.
<li><b>Pass</b> orders doubler to lead a trump.

</ul>

If advancer bids a suit cheaply, opener rebids his suit, and doubler doubles
again, it shows 16-18 HCP and three-card support for advancer.  [E.g.,
(1<img src="d.gif" alt="D">) X (P) 1<img src="s.gif" alt="S"> : (2<img src="d.gif" alt="D">) X.]

With the rare strong hands, doubler can bid a new suit to show roughly that
playing strength, bid 1NT with 16-18 HCP, bid 2NT with 19-20 HCP, or
cue-bid with 21+.

<h3>Cuebids</h3>

We play Michaels Cuebids, solid-suit jump cuebids, and some 
natural cuebids in the sandwich seat.

<h4> Simple Cuebids</h4>

Simple cuebids in the direct seat are Michaels:

<ul>
  <li><b>Cuebid of a minor</b> shows both majors.
  <li><b>Cuebid of a major</b> shows the unbid major and an unspecified
    minor.
</ul>

The point range is either weak (0-12) or strong (17+).  We tend to have 5-5, but may have 5-4 nonvulnerable.  We also promise good suits, averaging around 7.5 SQ. 

In response to a Michaels cuebid, advancer has the following options:

<ul>
  <li><b>2NT after a major-suit cuebid</b> asks for partner's minor.  
    In competition, 4<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> or 4NT is used, depending on availability.  
  <li><b>2NT after a minor-suit cuebid</b> is natural and invitational to
    3NT.
  <li><b>Re-cue</b> is a game or slam try and is forcing one round.  Partner
    must rebid the cheapest of his two suits with a weak two-suiter; any
    other bid shows the strong two-suiter.
  <li><b>All other bids</b> are to play.
</ul>

<h4>Rebids by Cuebidder</h4>

Most of the time, the cuebidder will cooperate with advancer's request. 
However, after an attempted sign-off, bidding a known suit only promises
extra length; weird-sounding actions (cue-bid, further notrump bid, double or
redouble) indicate one of the 17+ hands.

<h4> Balancing Cuebids</h4>

In the balancing seat, a cuebid by a hand that has not had a previous
opportunity to do so is Michaels, showing 13+ HCP.  Weak hands either
overcall in the higher suit and rebid the lower, or pass, declining to let
the opponents find a better strain.

If the balancing hand could have shown the suits earlier, a cuebid is<b>
natural</b>. 

<h4> Sandwich Cuebids</h4>

In the sandwich seat, a cuebid of <b>opener's</b> suit is Michaels, with no
point count restrictions.  Cuebid of <b>responder's</b> suit is <b>natural</b>.

For example, after (1<img src="d.gif" alt="D">) : P : (1<img src="s.gif" alt="S">),

<ul>
  <li><b>Double:</b> Opening bid with 4-4 in the round suits or better
  <li><b>1NT:</b> [x4x5] and 7-11 HCP
  <li><b>2<img src="c.gif" alt="C">:</b>  natural, 5+
  <li><b>2<img src="d.gif" alt="D">:</b>  [x5x5], less than an opening bid
  <li><b>2<img src="h.gif" alt="H">:</b>  natural, 5+
  <li><b>2<img src="s.gif" alt="S">:</b>  natural; 5+ spades, 8+ points
  <li><b>2NT:</b> [x 5+ x 6+] (rare)
</ul>

<h4> Jump Cuebids</h4>

Whenever partner has not bid, a jump cuebid shows a long, strong suit with
8.5 playing tricks and no stopper in the enemy suit.  If opener's suit
is a major, this guarantees a singleton or void in the enemy suit.

Advancer has these options:

<ul>
  <li><b>Cheapest NT</b> shows a stopper and less than 1.5 QT.
  <li><b>Jump in NT</b> shows a stopper and at least 1.5 QT.
  <li><b>Cheapest minor</b> is artificial and weak.
  <li><b>Expensive minor</b> is rare, but likely to be artificial and
    strong.
  <li><b>Jump in minor</b> is natural.
  <li><b>All major suit bids</b> are natural.
</ul>

In competition, advances are based on common sense.  Pass with weakness, bid
NT with a stopper, bid cheaper minor with a constructive hand, and double for
penalties.

<h4>Rebids by Cuebidder</h4>

Rebids also follow common sense.  Any new suit shows the solid suit, and a
4NT rebid is Blackwood.

<h3>Opponents Open a Weak Two</h3>

<p>Our defenses to this common annoyance are pretty standard.  A direct 2NT shows 15-18 and a direct 3NT shows 19+.  All three-level cue-bids ask partner to bid 3NT with a stopper.  We also use Leaping Michaels and Lebensohl after a double:</p>

<h4>Leaping Michaels</h4>

<p>After a 2M opening, a jump-shift to 4m shows that minor and the other major.  3M asks partner to bid 3NT with a stopper.</p>

<p>After a 2<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> opening, 4<img src="c.gif" alt="C"> shows clubs and a major, and 4<img src="d.gif" alt="D"> shows the majors.  3M is natural, showing a nine-trick hand.</p>

<h4>Lebensohl</h4>

<p>After a direct or balancing double of a weak two, Lebensohl is on:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>2 of any suit</b> is to play.  Doubler should only continue with a
    huge hand.
  <li><b>3 of any suit</b> is natural and shows a good hand.  This is
    game-forcing after a direct double.  If doubler was balancing on
    cheese, he may pass (as advancer is limited by his initial pass).
  <li><b>3NT</b> shows complete confidence that this is the right place
    (pretty much promising a double stopper).
  <li><b>Cue-bid</b> is a general force.
  <li><b>2NT</b> is a relay to 3<img src="c.gif" alt="C">, after which advancer may pass with
    clubs and a bad hand or:
  <ul>
    <li><b>3 of a suit below opener's</b> is to play.
    <li><b>3 of a suit above opener's</b> shows invitational strength.
    <li><b>3NT</b> expresses more doubt than a direct 3NT, typically
      because you don't like your stopper (Qxx, for instance).
  </ul>
</ul>

<a name="#Carding"><h3>Carding Agreements</h3></a>

<h3>Signalling Principles</h3>

Our signal hierarchy is attitude first, count second, and suit-preference
third.  We use upside-down count and attitude:  low encourages or shows an
even number, high discourages or shows an odd number.  In suit-preference
situations, the higher spot card indicates the higher-ranking side suit
excluding trump. 

All signals should be made to help partner with the defense; they are not
commands.  If partner does not need the information, do not signal.  Above
all, we try<b>never to tell declarer anything</b> he needs to know, so do not
expect or give signals in a critical suit for declarer. 

<h3>Opening Leads</h3>

We tend to lead aggressively unless the auction clearly calls for a passive
lead.  Since we do not lead trumps without reason, partner must have a good
reason to discontinue a trump attack.

Against suit contracts, we use third and fifth best leads: xxX, xxXx,
xxxxX, xxXxxx. In particular, we lead low from three small unless partner
has bid the suit and we have supported.  We lead the ace from ace-king in
general, except when it is doubleton or against a five-level or higher
contract, when the ace asks for attitude and the king for count. Other
leads are standard.

Against notrump contracts, we use standard fourth-best leads.  We lead the
top of three small cards unless partner has bid the suit and we have not
supported.  From four or more small cards, we lead fourth best if we want
partner to continue the suit, or a high spot if not.  Sequence leads are
standard: the lead of an ace asks partner to unblock an honor or give count. 
From KQT9, we lead the queen.

If third hand can determine that the opening leader has made an unusual
opening lead (i.e. underlead of an ace at a trump contract, or the deuce from
a five-card suit), this is an "alarm clock signal" and means that third
hand should try to find an unusual defense (usually hitting a void).

<h3>Third-Hand Signals</h3>

If third hand does not have to play high to attempt to win the trick,
his signals are primarily<b>attitude</b>, with the following exceptions:

<ul>
  <li> Third hand holds the QJ and partner leads the Ace.  Third hand can
    play the Queen to let partner know he can underlead the King. 
  <li> Dummy wins the trick and contains another honor higher than leader's
    card.  With two or more honors of the led suit in dummy, third hand gives
    count.
  <li> Partner leads the King against a slam contract.  Third hand gives
    count.
  <li> Partner leads third hand's suit in which the bidding has shown to be 
    at least 6 cards.  Third hand gives suit preference: high card = higher
    suit, low card = lower suit, middle card = continue.
</ul>

<h3>Later Signals</h3>

<h3>Leads and Returns</h3>

After an 3-card or longer honor sequence is led, continuing with the bottom 
of the sequence requests partner to unblock and continuing with the next 
highest requests partner to hold off.

In general, when a defender switches to a new suit, a high spot card 
denies interest in the new suit, while a low spot card shows tolerance for 
a return and is fourth-best if possible.  Sometimes, though, a defender
has no choice but to lead a particular spot card (i.e. for a surrounding
play)  Do not let the size of the card lull you into complacency!  

If the defender switches to an honor card, the opening lead structure
applies, except that the K should now be led from the AK.

If a defender ever returns a led suit, he plays his highest card with
one or two cards remaining, and his original fourth-best otherwise.  The
first discard from this suit should be the same card that would be returned. 
This is the one exception to giving attitude on the first discard.

<h3> Following Suit</h3>

Whenever a defender peters in trump, it shows an odd number of trumps. 
However, like all count signals, they should be used with discretion. 
Note that these peters also apply to ruffs and overruffs. 

When declarer shows out of a suit, each defender knows the other's exact 
holding in that suit.  Therefore, all voluntarily played cards in that suit 
should be played in suit-preference order.

When declarer plays on a suit that could be missing a key honor, the
defenders should signal the count in that suit.  Later rounds of the suit 
can be suit-preference.  The defense is advised to avoid excessive count
signals as that tends to help declarer more than the defense.  (Exception:
if declarer is known to be inattentive, signal whenever possible!)

<h3> Discards</h3>

Our first discard is always attitude, except in the case of a suit led 
by partner (see above).  In addition, if a defender discards a point card, 
he denies the card above it and promises at least a 3-card honor sequence.
We strive to discard immediately from the suit we cannot guard, but common 
sense takes precedence as it may be declarer's guess suit.

Subsequent discards in a suit show count based on the present number of
cards held, not the original number. 

Also, against notrumps, we tend to make discouraging discards, as using an 
encouraging card may throw away a trick.

<a name="#Eval"><h3>Hand Evaluation</h3></a>

We use several different metrics to evaluate hands:

<ul>

<li><b>High-card points (HCP)</b>: What you learned from Goren.  they are:
A=4, K=3, Q=2, J=1.

<li><b>Length points (LP)</b>: One for every card past the fourth in a suit. 
This might be less if the suit is very empty.

<li><b>Points:</b> HCP + LP \pm subjective adjustments for acelessness,
acefulness, honors in long/short suits, presence/absence of good spots.  Also
known as "notrump points". 

<li><b>Short-suit points (SSP)</b>: If you're the short trump hand, count 1
for a doubleton, 3 for a singleton, 5 for a void.  If you're the long trump
hand, count 1 for a doubleton, 2 for a singleton, 3 for a void. 

<li><b>Suit points (SP)</b>: HCP + LP + SSP.
