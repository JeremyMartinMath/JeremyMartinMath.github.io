<center><b>THE RABBIT, THE FOX, AND THE WOLF  - A GRADUATE STUDENT 
FABLE</b></center>

<hr><br>

<b>Chapter One</b><p>

One sunny day, a rabbit came out of her hole in the ground to enjoy the
weather.  The day was so nice that the rabbit became careless, and a fox
sneaked up behind her and caught her.<p>

"I am going to eat you for lunch!"  said the fox.<p>

"Wait!" replied the rabbit.  "You should at least wait a few days."<p>

"Oh yeah?  Why should I wait?" sneered the fox.<p>

"I am almost finished writing my Ph.D. thesis," the rabbit said<p>

"Hah!  That's a stupid excuse.  What is the title of your thesis
anyway?"<p>

"I am writing a thesis on `The Superiority Of Rabbits Over Foxes And
Wolves.'"<p>

"Are you crazy? I should eat you right now!" the fox snarled.  "Everybody
knows that a fox will always win a fight with a rabbit."<p>

"Not really, according to my research," said the rabbit.  "If you'd like,
you can come to my hole and read it for yourself.  If you're not
convinced, you can go ahead and have me for lunch."<p>

"You really are crazy!" replied the fox.  But the fox was pretty curious,
and figured he had nothing to lose, so he went with the rabbit into its
hole.  The fox never came back out.<p>

<b>Chapter Two</b><p>

A few days later the rabbit was again taking a break from writing. Sure
enough, a wolf came out of the bushes, caught the rabbit, and was getting
ready to eat her.<p>

"Wait!"  yelled the rabbit, "you cannot eat me right now."<p>

"And why might that be, you fuzzy appetizer?"<p>

"I am almost finished writing my Ph.D. thesis on "The Superiority Of
Rabbits Over Foxes And Wolves.'"<p>

The wolf laughed so hard it almost lost its hold on the rabbit.

"Maybe I shouldn't eat you-- you really are sick in the head and you
might have something contagious!" the wolf opined.<p>

"Come read for yourself.  You can eat me after that if you disagree
with my conclusions."<p>

So the wolf went into the rabbit's hole... and like the fox, he never came
back out.<p>

<b>Chapter Three</b><p>

A few weeks later, the rabbit finished writing her thesis and was out
celebrating in the lettuce fields.  Another rabbit came by and asked,
"What's up? You seem to be very happy."<p>

"Yup, I just finished writing my dissertation."<p>

"Congratulations!  What is it about?"<p>

"It is entitled `The Superiority Of Rabbits Over Foxes And Wolves.'"<p>

"Are you sure?  That doesn't sound right."<p>

"Oh, yes, you should come over and read for yourself."<p>

So they went off together to the rabbit's hole.<p>

As they entered, the friend saw what looked like a typical graduate
student abode-- albeit a rather messy one after writing a thesis.  The
computer with the controversial dissertation was in one corner of the
room.  On the right there was a pile of fox bones, on the left was a pile
of wolf bones, and in the middle was a lion.<p>

And the moral of the story is:<p>

<i>Who you are doesn't matter.  What the title of your dissertation is
doesn't matter.<p>
All that matters is who your thesis advisor is.</i><p>
