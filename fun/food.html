<p><h4>
A recipe is supposed to be a formula, a means prescribed for producing a desired result, whether 
that be an atomic weapon, a well-trained Pekingese, or an omelet.  There can be... no &quot;little 
secrets.&quot;  A cook who indulges in such covert and destructive vanity as to leave out one 
ingredient of a recipe which someone has admired and asked to copy is not honest, and therefore 
is not a <i>good cook</i>.  He is betraying his profession and his art... and no deep-fat 
kettle is too hot to brown him in.</h4>

<p><b>Beef Not Exactly Bourguignon</b></p>

<p>Red wine makes fantastic beef stew.  Authentic boeuf Bourguignon would
of course call for Pinot Noir, but if you're planning a stew, I think
you get the best bang for your wine buck
with an inexpensive Australian Shiraz (at the risk of a Burgundian
defamation suit).  On the other hand, if you open a bottle of any old
red wine and find that the bottle is corky, why then, don't pour it down the sink;
make a beef stew.  I'm constantly fiddling with the recipe; what follows
is about three years old (and a newer version is below).

<ul>
<li>1/2 pound mushrooms, quartered
<li>1/2 pound baby carrots (do Solomon one 
better and cut each one in three pieces)
<li>3 cloves garlic, minced
<li>2 medium onions, sliced (about 1/2 pound)
<li>2 pounds stew meat, cut in approximately 1&quot; cubes (I like to buy a big
chuck roast and butcher it myself; chuck has good flavor, is not too expensive,
and I get better results than from packages labeled &quot;stew meat&quot;)
<li>1 can low-salt beef broth (I'm sure it would be better with homemade 
beef stock, but I don't have that kind of time)
<li>4-5 dried shiitake mushrooms (optional but highly recommended)
<li>1/2 cup flour
<li>1/2 bottle (about 1 1/2 cups) red wine
<li>Salt
<li>Pepper
<li>Sugar
<li>Butter
<li>Canola oil
<li>A couple of bay leaves
</ul>

<p>Prep work: Slice the fresh mushrooms, carrots, onions, garlic and meat
as indicated.  Soak the dried mushrooms in a cup or so of warm water for
half an hour, then remove them and chop finely.  Reserve the water.  In a
good-sized Tupperware (with a lid), combine flour with a big pinch of
salt, a small pinch of sugar, and several generous grinds black pepper.  
</p>

<p>In a skillet (preferably not non-stick), saute onions in butter until
golden brown.  Transfer to a Dutch oven.  Saute fresh mushrooms in butter.  
Transfer to the Dutch oven.  Deglaze the pan with red wine and transfer
the browned stuff to the Dutch oven.  Dredge the meat in the flour, brown
it in canola oil, and transfer it to the Dutch oven.  (You'll probably
have to both dredge and brown in batches.  A Tupperware works great for
dredging because you can put the lid on and shake it, coating the meat
evenly with flour.)  Deglaze again.  Saute the garlic very briefly (so it
doesn't burn), and... you guessed it... transfer it to the Dutch oven.  
Add directly to the Dutch oven:  wine, beef broth, carrots, a couple of
bay leaves, chopped dried mushrooms, and soaking liquid thereof.  Cook
over low heat until meat is tender, about 2 hours.</p>

<p><b>Another method:</b> Cut up beef, slice an onion, and marinate in half
a bottle of red wine for 2 hours.  Forget the flour.  Brown meat in canola oil
over medium-high heat (probably in batches); transfer to plate as it is done.
Add onions and several cloves chopped garlic and let saute for a gew minutes.
Add chopped shiitakes and cook 1 minute.  Add marinating liquid (deglazing if
necessary), mushroom soaking liquid, 1 package sliced crimini mushrooms, 4
anchovies chopped finely, 25 baby carrots cut into cubes, a couple of bay
leaves, several branches
fresh thyme, and reserved beef (with whatever liquid it's emitted).  Stew until
meat is tender.  Other possible additions: potatoes and parsnips.  One day
if I am up to it, I may try making spaetzle.

<p><b>Saratoga Chicken</b></p>

<p>Given to us by Elaine Kirk, a friend of Jennifer's parents.  
Easy to prepare and amazingly good.</p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup olive oil
<li>2 cloves garlic, crushed
<li>1 tsp dried oregano
<li>1 tsp herb-seasoned salt
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper
<li>1/4 cup Dijon mustard
<li>Juice of 1 lemon (about 1/4 cup)
<li>4 whole boneless chicken breasts
</ul>

<p>In a glass pan, combine marinade ingredients with a whisk.  Add chicken
(you can cut the breasts in half).  Marinate in refrigerator for several
hours.  Grill chicken for 5 minutes, turn gently with spatula, and grill
an additional 5 minutes or until chicken is opaque and juices run clear. 
Baste with marinade as necessary while grilling.</p>

(You can replace the olive oil with cheaper canola without doing any harm to the
recipe.  Also, I frequently forget to baste while the chicken is on the grill;
it still tastes plenty good, particularly if the chicken has marinated overnight.)

<p><b>Lemon Bars</b></p>

<p>My mom's recipe.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice is a must.
</p>

<ul>
<li>1/2 cup butter (1 stick)
<li>1 cup + 2 Tbsp flour
<li>1/2 cup confectioner's (powdered) sugar, sifted
<li>2 eggs
<li>1 cup sugar
<li>1/2 tsp salt
<li>3 Tbsp lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon), or more if desired (I usually use much more!)
<li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder
</ul>

<p>Preheat oven to 350&deg;.  Cream butter, 1 cup flour and confectioner's sugar together.  Press
into an 8&quot; square pan.  Bake at 350&deg; for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>While the crust is baking, beat the eggs well and add sugar, salt, and
lemon juice.  Combine baking powder and 2 Tbsp flour separately and
combine with egg mixture.  Pour over the hot crust and bake at 350&deg; until
golden brown, typically 20-25 minutes (ovens vary considerably).</p>

<p><b>Candied Carrots and Sweet Potatoes</b></p>

<p>Grandma Norma's original recipe, and absolutely indispensable to a
Martin family Thanksgiving.  Despite the amounts given, you can be sure
Grandma never bothered to pull a measuring spoon out of the drawer and
level off two scoops of brown sugar.  So even if you learned to cook from
the Anal Retentive Chef, don't you bother either, because you're going to
be adding more sugar and syrup every 15 minutes anyway, and there's no
such thing as overdoing it.</p>
 
<p>Use 2 lbs carrots (as though I've ever weighed them), peeled, and maybe 3-4 good-sized sweet potatoes,
sliced thickly. Melt 1 tbsp margarine, oil or chicken fat in a coverable
pan (Corningware is good).  Sprinkle 2-3 Tbsp brown sugar in pan to absorb
butter and melt sugar. Add a little salt.  Melt gradually on low to medium
flame.  When it starts to caramelize, add 1 Tbsp fake maple syrup.  (Don't
waste the good stuff.  Store-brand
high-fructose-corn-syrup-plus-caramel-coloring-and-preservatives will work
just fine.) Drop carrots and sweet potatoes in and turn around to coat. 
Sprinkle more brown sugar on top of carrots.  Let simmer for a while,
maybe an hour or two, covered, occasionally (every 15 minutes or so) 
rearranging and adding more syrup or sugar, while you make the rest of
your Thanksgiving dinner.  They should be brown, somewhat wrinkled, and
soft but not quite falling apart.  The carrots take longer to cook than
the sweet potatoes. Mom sometimes uses corn syrup, which would probably be
fine but is not something I generally have in the house.  The recipe
suggests a little vanilla, which neither Mom nor I have used, but how
could it possibly hurt?  We've discussed the possibility of adding a little bit
of booze, bourbon for instance, although Grandma would certainly not approve.
