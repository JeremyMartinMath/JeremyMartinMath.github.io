<h2>Graduate Programs with Financial Support for MA/MS Students</h2>

<p>This is a (highly non-exhaustive, and lightly maintained) list of 
institutions that offer financial support to MA/MS students in math, 
applied math or statistics.  This is for information only; no 
endorsement of any programs is implied.  Much of the information on this page
may be out of date,
<strong>particularly in the COVID-19 era</strong>, so please contact individual 
departments for more information.  E-mail Jeremy Martin (address

<ul>
<li>
Pittsburg State University (Pittsburg, KS)

<li>
Emporia State University (Emporia, KS)

<li> Villanova offers two forms of assistance for Master's students.  
One is a tuition waiver with no stipend for 7 hours/week of work.  One 
is a tuition-waiver with stipend (about $1600/mo) for 15 hours/week of 
work.  Master's degrees are offered in Mathematics and Applied Statistics.

<li> Boise State University offers an MS in Mathematics with emphases in 
Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics and an <a 
href="https://math.boisestate.edu/degrees/ms-math-ed/"> MS in 
Mathematics Education</a>. Most students are supported by TAships.

<li> Southern Illinois University at Carbondale routinely funds MS 
students.  According to a faculty member: &quot;We also have a Ph.D. program, but we have quite a lot of 
students who only intend and only take the master's.&quot;

<li> <a 
href="http://college.wfu.edu/math/prospective-graduate-students">Wake 
Forest</a> has a master's only MA program in mathematics.  A student can 
do a master's thesis on a statistics topic for this degree.  Typical 
audience is drawn from both students wanting a terminal master's degree 
and students considering a PhD who feel rather unprepared.  ~10 fully 
funded TA positions a year.  Those not awarded a TA position don't have 
to pay undergrad tuition. Class sizes average 15/year.

<li> Clemson has a standalone MS program (along with a PhD program), and 
there is TA support for students in both programs.

<li> Northwest Missouri State University offers both an MS and an MSEd 
in Math (and Math Education).

<li> <a href="http://campus.udayton.edu/~mathdept/MASdegree.htm">The 
University of Dayton</a> offers three terminal Master's degrees in math, 
including one in applied math.  (The others are MathEd and Financial 
Math.)  Proximity to Wright Patterson AFB helps those students who are 
actually "living" applied math to study it. Contact Paul Eloe, Director 
of Graduate Studies.

<li> <a 
href="http://www.uni.edu/math/academics/master-arts-degrees-mathematics#psm">The 
University of Northern Iowa</a> has a Professional Science Masters 
Degree in Industrial Mathematics:

<li> University of Michigan-Dearborn (applied)

<li> University of Texas at Arlington (applied)

<li> Southeast Louisana University (applied).  Contact Dr. Ken Li (<a 
href="mailto:kli@selu.edu">kli@selu.edu</a>) about their ISAT Masters 
(Integrated Science and Technology.)

<li> Michigan State University: master's in industrial mathematics

<li> Miami University (Ohio) has master's programs and no Ph.D.

<li> Ball State University (Muncie, IN) funds master's programs in statistics and 
possibly math master's degrees as well.

<li> <a 
href="http://cosm.georgiasouthern.edu/math/student-resources/graduate-degree">Georgia 
Southern University</a> has masters-only programs in Applied 
Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Statistics and Computational Science 
(interdisciplinary). They do have assistantships available.

<li> Sam Houston State has smaller but thriving MS programs in both math 
and statistics.  About 20 new students each year, most of them 
funded at $13,000 per year (in exchange for 20 hours of light work per 
week).  Tuition is low, as are living expenses in Huntsville.

<li> South Dakota State University has an MS program in Mathematics and 
an MS program in Statistics.  These students are eligible for 
assistantships.  Also has an MS in Data Science- these students 
usually are not eligible for assistantships.

<li> Western Michigan University supports some masters students with 
TAships.  How many depends on the year, and students may have to pay 
part of their way until a TAship becomes available.

<li> <a href="http://hs.umt.edu/math">University of Montana</a>

<li> <a 
href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/mathematics-and-statistics.html">Bowling 
Green State University (Ohio)</a>: Master's program with concentrations 
in Pure Math, Scientific Computation, Statistics, Applied Statistics, 
and Teaching Mathematics: Almost all grad students are supported with TA 
positions.

<li> University of Florida (which has a PhD program): almost all grad 
students are supported with TA positions.

<li> University of Texas, El Paso offers MS-Math but not PhD in Math. 
There is a PhD in computational math (interdisciplinary with College of 
Engineering), but its students are not in competition with MS-Math 
students for TA-ship.

<li> Western Washington University offers a master's in math and funds 
many of their graduate students.  They do not have a PhD program.

<li> University of Washington has a <a 
href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu/program/admissions/costs">master's 
program in biostatistics</a>. that offers funding.  According to their 
website (5/21/18), &quot;We offer funding to PhD students and partner 
with the UW to offer funding to highly qualified underrepresented 
minority MS students.&quot;

<li> Northern Arizona University supports about 30-35 graduate teaching 
assistants in our MS programs (closer to 40 this year).  They offer MS 
degrees in Mathematics, Statistics, and Mathematics Education.  Many 
graduates go on to PhD study.

<li> University of California, Riverside has an MA/MS program (in either 
pure or applied math), and accepted students are guaranteed 5 quarters 
of support in the form of TAships.  (That is usually sufficient to 
finish the requirements.)  Typically 1-3 masters students incoming each 
year.

<li> <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/math/graduates/index.html">University 
of Minnesota Duluth</a> offers a MS in Applied and Computational 
Mathematics with focus in modeling, statistics, or discrete math.

<li> <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/grad_program.php">San Francisco State 
University</a>: masters-only program funded by TAships and scholarships. 
They regularly send students afterwards to PhD programs. They have 
several faculty doing geometry and combinatorics.

<li><a 
href="http://www.math.illinois.edu/GraduateProgram/financial-support-ms.html">The 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a> offers full financial 
support to students in the Masters in the Teaching of Mathematics 
program.

<li><a href="http://www.uaf.edu/dms/">University of Alaska 
Fairbanks</a>: MS in Mathematics and MS in Statistics. TAships are 
available for both programs.

<li>University of Connecticut: same support for MA and PhD students.

<li>University of Georgia: the <a 
href="http://www.stat.uga.edu/degrees/graduate/prosepective-students">
Department of Statistics</a> supports both 
MS and PhD students.  According to their <a 
href="https://stat.franklin.uga.edu/sites/default/files/grad_financial_assistance.pdf"> 
Financial Assistance</a> document (as of 5/21/18), &quot;Financial 
assistance is usually granted to MS students for a period of 2 
years.&quot;

<li>University of Kentucky: the <a 
href="https://stat.as.uky.edu/statistics-financial-aid">Department 
of Statistics</a> supports both MS and PhD students.  According to their 
website (as of 5/21/18), &quot;Supported students making normal progress 
toward their degree may expect to be supported 2 years for a 
Master's.&quot;

<li><a href="http://www.sfu.ca/math/graduate/programs.html">Simon Fraser University (Canada)</a>
offers research M.Sc. degrees in Mathematics, Applied and Computational
Mathematics and Operations Research that are funded through a mix of
TA and RA support.  

<p>
General note on Canadian graduate programs (thanks to Tamon Stephen): 
In Canada the funding model encourages the production of research-based Master's degrees.  So most 
good Canadian schools are possibilities if students are up for crossing the border.  Support packages 
generally include money from teaching and research assistantships.  Ideal candidates for this are 
people who may be interested in a Ph.D. but are also considering non-academic possibilities.  Students 
will spend time alongside Ph.D. students, and Master's degrees leading to a nice industrial placement, 
or to continuing to a Ph.D. at the same institution or elsewhere are all considered good outcomes.

<li>University of Arizona: the <a href="https://www.math.arizona.edu/academics/grads/prospective#finances">Mathematics 
Department offers suopport to both MA/MS and PhD students (website last viewed 3/3/21).
