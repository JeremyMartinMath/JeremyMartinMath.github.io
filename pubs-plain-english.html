<h3>Publications of Jeremy L. Martin </h3>

<p>This is an attempt to explain (at least some of) my research in a way that is accessible 
to intelligent people who are not, or perhaps not yet, professional mathematicians.  I have 
tried to use as little jargon as possible.  I would be delighted to hear from you if you find 
something here that you either (a) think is interesting or (b) don't understand (so I can 
clarify it).  If you are looking for more technical details, you should probably visit <a

<b>Oscillation estimates of eigenfunctions via the combinatorics of noncrossing partitions</b>

Preprint (9/7/16)

<p>My coauthors study partial differential equations, which model things like fluid flow and heat dispersion.  They draw pictures that look like tangled-up spaghetti, then try to measure the complexity of the equations by counting the holes in the tangle.  Well, counting is what I do for a living, and when I saw their pictures, I was able to use what I know about counting to help them solve their problem.

<b>A non-partitionable Cohen-Macaulay simplicial complex</b></a>
  (with <a href="http://www.math.utep.edu/Faculty/duval/home.html">Art M. Duval</a>,
        <a href="http://people.ku.edu/~b916g848/">Bennet Goeckner</a>, and

<p>An area of combinatorics known as <i>Stanley-Reisner theory</i> provides a way to essentially add and multiply the vertices, edges, triangles and other faces.
Stanley-Reisner theory is a powerful tool to study simplicial complexes because it lets us translate between algebra, topology and combinatorics
(and I've used it before, particularly in <a href="#slopes">this paper</a>).
In particular, one can study the property of being <i>Cohen-Macaulay</i> through any or all of these three complementary lenses.
The precise definition of Cohen-Macaulayness is pretty technical, but suffice it to say that (1) it's very important; (2) lots of complexes encountered in nature have it;
(3) we can say exactly what it means in algebraic or topological terms; (4) we <i>can't</i> quite explain it combinatorially.  A Cohen-Macaulay complex does have to obey
strong restrictions on the numbers of faces of each dimension, and Richard Stanley had conjectured in 1979 that these restrictions could be explained by a <i>partitioning</i>,
a certain way of breaking the complex into easily countable pieces.  (Adriano Garsia had independently made essentially the same conjecture for a slightly more restricted class
of Cohen-Macaulay complexes.)

<p>Well, we have bad news.  The conjecture turns out to be false.  We explicitly constructed a simplicial complex that is Cohen-Macaulay, but cannot have a partitioning.  Here's what 
it looks like: take three identical soccer balls, choose a hexagon on each one, and glue all three chosen hexagons together.  You can't do this in 
three-dimensional space (you could if there were only two soccer balls instead of three) but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist; it just means you have to use your imagination a 
little to understand <a href="figure-C3.jpg">this picture of it</a>.  (The red, green and blue pieces are the soccer balls; the gray area represents the hexagon where they are attached.)

<p>The upshot is that the Cohen-Macaulay property is more subtle than we thought it was.  It is still an open problem to give a convincing combinatorial explanation of why
the face numbers of Cohen-Macaulay complexes are what they are.

  <i>Graphs</i> are neat, but <i>simplicial complexes</i> are neater: instead of 
restricting yourself to vertices and edges, why not allow yourself 
triangles, tetrahedra, and higher-dimensional pieces?  Many facts about graphs can be 
generalized to 
simplicial complexes.  Art, Carly and I collaborated on defining what it 
means for one simplicial complex to be a spanning tree of another one, and 
generalizing the Matrix-Tree Theorem to count such simplicial spanning 
trees algebraically.  (Our definition and formula are based on an idea 
originally due to Gil Kalai, and in a slightly different form by Ethan 
Bolker.)  We applied this general result to count the simplicial spanning 
trees of a particularly nice kind of simplicial complexes called 
<i>shifted complexes</i>; our result ends up generalizing and unifying 
several previously known results.  Having done that for a while, we started
looking at spanning trees of even more general combinatorial-topological objects
known as <i>cell complexes</i>.  Many of the results about simplicial complexes
carry over naturally to the setting of cell complexes, and there turn out to be
nice formulas (at least, we think they're nice) for counting spanning trees
of cubes of various dimensions.

<a name="chromatic">
  <b>On distinguishing trees by their chromatic symmetric functions</a></b>
  (with Matthew Morin and Jennifer D. Wagner)
<br>
  <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/locate/issn/0097-3165">
  <i>Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A</i></a> <b>115</b> (2008), 237--253.

  A tree is a bunch of points (&quot;vertices&quot;) held together by as 
few lines (&quot;edges&quot;) as possible (see also the paper <a 
href="#spantree">&quot;Factorizations of some spanning tree 
enumerators&quot;</a> below).  How many ways are there to color the 
vertices of a tree using \(k\) different colors so that no two adjacent 
vertices receive the same color?  The answer to this question is well 
known; it's \(k(k-1)^{n-1}\), where \(n\) is the 
number of vertices.  Remarkably, it doesn't depend on which particular 
tree you pick, just how many vertices it has (and there are a <i>lot</i> 
of ways to build a tree on \(n\) vertices; for example, there are 106 
different 10-vertex trees).

<p>
  However, Richard Stanley came up with a more detailed way to count 
colorings, called the <i>chromatic symmetric function</i> (essentially, 
keeping track of how many times each color is used) which preserves much 
more information about the tree.  No one knows whether the chromatic 
symmetric functions of different trees have to be different.  This problem 
seems to be very hard, but Matthew, Jennifer and I were able to make some 
progress on it.  What we proved is that you can recover a lot of 
information about a tree from its chromatic symmetric function.  For 
example, you can tell how many vertices are connected to \(i\) other 
vertices for every possible value of \(i\); how many pairs of vertices 
are \(j\) steps apart for every possible value of \(j\); and much 
more.

<p>
  In addition, for certain very nice kinds of trees (with catchy names 
like &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;caterpillars&quot;) the chromatic 
symmetric function really does determine the tree uniquely.  One possible 
application of all this might be in biology or chemistry, of all things; 
trees arise from the atomic and molecular structure of things like 
hydrocarbons and proteins.

  A famous fact called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that 
every polynomial has as many roots as its degree: for instance, there 
are five real numbers \(x\) that satisfy \(x^5+4x-1=0\). We don't 
necessarily know how to find them exactly, but they're out there 
somewhere.  Of course, they might be complex numbers instead of real 
numbers, but we don't mind that so much. Gauss first proved this theorem 
in 1799, using a beautiful geometric argument that involved drawing two 
curves and counting the points where the curves meet.  Dave, Ted and I 
got interested in classifying these curves (which end up looking a lot 
like the lines on a basketball) more precisely.  We ended up showing 
that any possible basketball does in fact occur for infinitely many 
polynomials.  We'd like to know what the basketball tells you about a 
polynomial and its roots; we understand the quadratic case (polynomials 
like \(x^2+4x-1\)) pretty well, but we don't yet know what information 
the basketball provides in degrees greater than 2.

  Actually, I lied.  It's impossible to unscramble the grid on the left.  
It turns out that exactly half of all possible scrambled grids can't be 
unscrambled (in fact, if you swap any two numbers while leaving the others 
alone, you will toggle the unscrambleability of the grid).  The algebraic 
object behind this phenomenon is something called the alternating group.  
(By the way, this puzzle was all the rage 
in about 1880.  Famous puzzle master Sam Loyd claimed to have invented it,
although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteen_puzzle">this may be an urban legend</a>.)

<p>
  John Conway had the idea of constructing an analogous puzzle by 
replacing the 4x4 grid with something called the <i>projective plane of 
order three</i>, which has thirteen instead of sixteen spots.  Instead of 
the alternating group, the underlying algebraic object controlling this 
puzzle is something called the <i>Mathieu group</i>.  This group is a bit 
subtle to describe, but Conway's idea gives a more concrete description of 
it.  Noam Elkies, my undergraduate advisor at Harvard, told me about 
Conway's idea.  In my undergraduate thesis, I worked out some of the 
details of Conway's construction on my own, and used the puzzle as a means 
to look at the structure of the Mathieu group.

Throw a bunch of darts at a dartboard.  Now tie a string between any two darts that are within
an inch of each other.  What is the chance that an ant walking along the string bridges can
move from any dart to any other dart, and how many bridges might the ant have to cross?  (Who
cares, you ask?  Well, the same model applies whenever you want to study connections between
objects in random locations -- such as cell phone networks or GPS systems, or the spread of
disease between trees in a forest.)  The answer clearly depends on how many darts there are
and how big the dartboard is.  My coauthors Rob and Catherine, together with Xingde Jia, had
looked at this problem previously; what we did in this paper was generalize their results to
many more kinds of dartboards.  First, the dartboard doesn't have to be circular: it can be a
sphere, or a higher-dimensional version of a sphere.  Second, you don't have to use the
ordinary straight-line distance between two points.  For example, you could require that you
can only walk north/south and east/west, instead of walking between two points in a straight line,
which would increase the distance between two points.  (You can measure distance in even weirder
ways if you want to.)  Our results still apply under these alternate metrics.

  A <i>perfect matching</i> is a way to group an even number of kids into 
pairs of buddies.  For example, if there are six kids, numbered 1 through 
6 in order of age, then there are fifteen ways of pairing them up: e.g., 
{14, 26, 35} or {13, 25, 46}.  How many buddy pairs will include two kids 
of consecutive ages?

  I've highlighted each pair of consecutive-age buddies in 
<b>boldface</b>, and organized the matchings by how many such pairs there 
are.  Counting the numbers of matchings in each row gives the sequence of 
numbers (1, 3, 6, 5).

<p>
  Astonishingly, perfect matchings turn out to be related to pictures of 
points and lines. Those polynomial relations I mentioned earlier, which 
constrain the directions of the line segments in a picture consisting of 
points and lines, turn out to have an incredibly nice algebraic structure.  
For the case of \(n\) points, every pair of which is connected by a 
line segment (making \(n(n-1)/2\) segments in all), I was 
able to use these polynomials to calculate the size of the space of 
pictures.  That size is encoded by something called its Hilbert series, 
and for the case of five points the Hilbert series turns out to be -- you 
guessed it! -- (1, 3, 6, 5).  In general, the Hilbert series for \(n\) 
points corresponds to counting consecutive-age buddy pairs in the set of 
matchings on a group of \(2n-4\) kids.  Simultaneously with the 
calculation of the Hilbert series, I showed that the space of all pictures 
is a <i>Cohen-Macaulay</i> variety: this means that while it has 
singularities (e.g., sharp corners instead of smooth points), it's not 
<i>too</i> singular --- in fact, it's nearly as nice as a smooth space in 
many ways.

  What does that space of all point-line arrangements (see the paper <a 
href="slopes">&quot;The slopes determined by \(n\) points in the 
plane&quot;</a> above) actually look like?  It turns out that it has lots 
of holes of various sizes.  The numbers and sizes of holes are recorded by 
something called the Poincar&eacute; series of the space, and what I was 
able to prove is that this is determined by something called the Tutte 
polynomial, which you can calculate if you know how many points you are 
starting with and which ones are connected with line segments.  In 
summary, if you understand the combinatorics (i.e., you have a list of 
points and line segments), then you can deduce facts about topology (i.e., 
the holes).  The formula for the Poincar&eacute; series works even if you 
allow pictures to be drawn in 3- or higher-dimensional space (instead of 
on a piece of paper).

  A square has four vertices and four edges.  If you remove any one of 
the edges, the vertices are still connected by the remaining three 
edges, but if you remove a second edge, the vertices fall apart.  So 
there are 4 different ways to connect the vertices with as few edges as 
possible.<p>
  A cube has 8 vertices and 12 edges.  It turns out that the fewest 
number of edges you need to keep the vertices connected is seven, and 
there are 384 ways to do this.  (Each of those ways is called a 
<i>spanning tree</i> of the cube.)<p>
  You can think of a cube as a three-dimensional version of a square.  
It turns out that you can construct an analogous object, called a 
hypercube, in any number of dimensions. An \(n\)-dimensional hypercube 
has \(2^n\) vertices, and the fewest number of edges you need to keep 
them connected is \(2^n-1\).  Using an algebraic tool called the 
Matrix-Tree Theorem, you can figure out a fairly nice formula for the 
number of spanning trees of a hypercube (depending, of course, on what 
\(n\) is).<p>
  Unfortunately, the formula says little or nothing about what those trees 
look like.  Vic and I were trying to find a more concrete way of proving 
the formula.  We didn't quite succeed (and the problem still remains 
unsolved), but we were able to add a lot of detail to the known formula.  
(An analogy: the old formula just gave the number of students at KU, while 
our results give information about how many are male, female, math majors, 
English majors, Kansans, Alaskans, etc.)  In attacking this problem, we 
developed a technique (based on work of Christian Krattenthaler) which 
could be applied to structures other than hypercubes.

  Take a piece of paper and draw four points.  Now connect every two 
points with a line segment; you will need a total of six segments.  (This 
whole setup is called a <i>picture</i>.) What can you say about the 
lengths of those line segments?  It turns out that if you tell me any five 
of the lengths, I can figure out the sixth one, even if I have no idea 
where the points are.  One way of rephrasing this is that the six lengths 
are mutually constrained; another way to look at it is that the structure 
of points and lines is &quot;rigid&quot; in a certain way.  Oddly, if you 
tell me five of the <i>directions</i> instead of the lengths, then all of 
this remains true: I can figure out the direction of the sixth line even 
without knowing the locations of the points.<p>
  More generally, you can start by drawing any number of points, 
connecting some or all of them with line segments, and asking what the 
mutual constraints are on the lengths or the directions.  I was able to 
figure out exactly what the direction constraints are for any such 
point-line picture by looking at the (very high-dimensional!) space of 
<i>all</i> such pictures.  The constraints turn out to be a set of 
polynomial relations on the directions, which you can write down 
explicitly, and which are indeed intimately connected to the problem of 
whether the arrangement is rigid (i.e., if you build a physical model of 
the arrangement out of bars and ball joints, will it hold its shape like a 
triangle or be floppy like a square, which can be deformed into a 
rhombus?)  One consequence of my results is the fact that every set of 
line segments have a length constraint if and only if they have a 
direction constraint.  (This was already known, but this approach
provides another proof; it never hurts to have more than one way to 
prove something.)
