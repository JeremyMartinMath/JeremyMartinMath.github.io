\prob Prove that the partition lattice $\Pi_n$ is a geometric lattice.  (Hint:
Construct a collection of vectors $S=\{s_{ij} \st 1\leq i<j\leq n\}$
in $\Rr^n$ such that $L(S)\isom\Pi_n$.)
% Next time: Make the hint more explicit - i.e., make them construct the representation instead of merely just suggesting that they do so.

\prob Let $\Ff$ be a field, let $n\in\Nn$, and
let $S$ be a finite subset of the vector space $\Ff^n$.
Recall the definitions of the lattices $L(S)$ and $\Laff(S)$
(lecture notes,\footnote{References to the lecture notes are to the version of 9/6/12 and may be off by a page or two if I make subsequent edits.} p.17).  For
$s=(s_1,\dots,s_n)\in S$, let $\hat s=(1,s_1,\dots,s_n)\in\Ff^{n+1}$, and let
$\hat S=\{\hat s\st s\in S\}$.
Prove that $L(\hat S)=\Laff(S)$.  (This is useful because it saves us a dimension --- e.g., many geometric lattices of rank~3 can be represented conveniently as affine point configurations in $\Rr^2.$)

%\prob Determine, with proof, all pairs of integers $k\leq n$ such
%that there exists a graph $G$ with $M(G)\isom U_k(n)$.  (Recall
%that $U_k(n)$ is the matroid on $E=[n]$ such that every
%subset of~$E$ of cardinality~$k$ is a basis.)

\prob Prove the equivalence of the two forms of the basis exchange condition
(lecture notes, p.24).
%  That is, if $\BB$ is a family of
%subsets of a finite set $E$, all of the same cardinality, and $B,B'\in\BB$, then
%\begin{align*}
%& \text{for every } e\in B\sm B', \text{ there exists } e'\in B'\sm B \text{ such that }
%  B\sm\{e\}\cup\{e'\}\in\BB\\
%\intertext{if and only if}
%& \text{for every } f\in B\sm B', \text{ there exists } f'\in B'\sm B \text{ such that }
%  B'\sm\{f'\}\cup\{f\}\in\BB.
%\end{align*}
(Hint: Consider $|B\sm B'|$.)

\prob Prove Proposition 2.20 (lecture notes, p.25)
which describes the equivalence between matroid independence systems
and matroid circuit systems.
% Next time: Give a hint about induction.

\prob Let $M$ be a matroid on ground set $E$ with rank function $r:2^E\to\Nn$.
Let $M^*$ be the dual matroid to $M$ and let $r^*:2^E\to\Nn$ be its rank function.
Find a formula for $r^*$ in terms of $r$.  (I.e., if I know $r(A)$ for every $A\subseteq E$,
how do I calculate $r(B)$ for a given $B\subseteq E$?)
% Next time: Give them the formula and tell them to prove it.  Students seem to not know what to do.

\prob Let $E$ be a finite set and let $\Delta$ be an \emph{abstract simplicial complex on $E$};
that is, a family of subsets with the property that if $A\in\Delta$ and $B\subseteq A$, then
$B\in\Delta$.  Let $w:E\to\Rr_{\geq 0}$ be any function; think of $w(A)$ as the ``weight'' of~$A$.
For $A\subseteq E$, define $w(A)=\sum_{e\in A} w(e)$.
Consider the problem of maximizing $w(A)$ over all maximal\footnote[2]{%
  Recall that ``maximal'' means ``not contained in any other element of $\Delta$'',
  which is logically weaker than ``of largest possible cardinality''.}
elements $A\in\Delta$
(also known as \emph{facets} of $\Delta$).  A naive approach
to try to produce such a set $A$, which may or may
not work for a given $\Delta$ and $w$, is the following \emph{greedy algorithm}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $A=\0$.
\item If $A$ is a facet of $\Delta$, stop.
Otherwise, find $e\in E\sm A$ of maximal weight such that $A\cup\{e\}\in\Delta$
   (if there are several such $e$, pick one at random), and replace $A$ with $A\cup\{e\}$.
\item Repeat step 2 until $A$ is a facet of $\Delta$.
\end{enumerate}

\probpart Construct a simplicial complex and a weight function for which this
  algorithm does not produce a facet of maximal weight.  (Hint: The smallest example 
has $|E|=3$.)

\probpart Prove that the following two conditions are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item The greedy algorithm produces a facet of maximal weight for \emph{every} weight function~$w$.
\item $\Delta$ is a matroid independence system.
\end{itemize}
% Next time: Don't let them use the theorem that a complex is matroidal iff every induced subcomplex is pure -- tell them to work with basis systems.
