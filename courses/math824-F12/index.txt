Problem Sets
All solutions must be typeset using LaTeX.
	•	Here is a header file with macros that may be useful.
	•	It is OK to draw figures by hand, although even better is to use something like xfig. I do not recommend the LaTeX "picture" environment.
E-mail me the PDF file under the name {your-last-name}{number-of-problem-set}.pdf.

Final Project
The final project is to read a current research article in combinatorics, give a short talk on it (20 minutes, like an AMS special session talk) to an audience of fellow graduate students, and provide constructive criticism on another student's talk. Here are full details and some suggestions for articles to read.
The presentations will take place on Thursday 12/13 and Friday 12/14. Here is the schedule (subject to change):
