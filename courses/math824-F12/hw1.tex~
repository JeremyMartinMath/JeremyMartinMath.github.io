\prob
A \emph{directed acyclic graph} or DAG, is a pair $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ 
is a finite set of \emph{vertices}; $E$ is a finite set of \emph{edges}, 
each of which is an ordered pair of distinct vertices; and $E$ contains 
no directed cycles, i.e., no subsets of the form
  $$\{(v_1,v_2),\: (v_2,v_3),\: \ldots,\: (v_{n-1},v_n),\: (v_n,v_1)\}$$
for any $v_1,\dots,v_n\in V$.

\probpart Let $P$ be a poset with order relation $<$.
Let $E=\{(v,w) \st v,w \in P, v<w\}$.  Prove that the pair $(P,E)$ is a 
DAG.

\probpart Let $G=(V,E)$ be a DAG.  Define a relation $<$ on $V$ by 
setting 
$v<w$ iff there is some directed path from $v$ to $w$ in $G$, i.e., iff 
$E$ has a subset of the form $\{(v_1,v_2),\: (v_2,v_3),\: \ldots,\: 
(v_{n-1},v_n)\}$ with $v=v_1$ and $w=v_n$.  Prove that this relation 
makes $V$ into a poset.

(This problem is purely a technical exercise, but it does show that 
posets and DAGs are essentially the same thing.)

\prob
Let $n$ be a positive integer.
Let $D_n$ be the set of all positive-integer divisors of $n$ (including $n$
itself), partially ordered by divisibility.

\probpart Prove that $D_n$ is a ranked poset, and describe the rank function.

\probpart For which values of $n$ is $D_n$ (i) a chain; (ii) a Boolean 
algebra?  For which values of $n,m$ is it the case that $D_n\isom D_m$?

\probpart Prove that $D_n$ is a distributive lattice.
  Describe its meet and join operations and its join-irreducible elements.

\probpart Prove that $D_n$ is \emph{self-dual}, i.e., there is a bijection $f:D_n\to D_n$
    such that $f(x)\leq f(y)$ if and only if $x\geq y$.

%\prob Let $G$ be a graph with connected components $G_1,\dots,G_r$.
%Describe the clique poset of $G$ in terms of the clique posets of
%$G_1,\dots,G_r$.

\prob
Prove that if $L$ is a lattice, then
  $$x\meet(y\join z)=(x\meet y)\join(x\meet z) \qquad \forall x,y,z\in L$$
if and only if
  $$x\join(y\meet z)=(x\join y)\meet(x\join z) \qquad \forall x,y,z\in L.$$
(A consequence is that $L$ is distributive if and only if $L^*$ is;
that is, distributivity is a self-dual condition.)

%Let $L_n(q)$ be the poset of subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space
%over the finite field $\Ff_q$.  Prove that $L_n(q)$ is a lattice and work out
%its rank-generating function.

\prob 
\probpart Describe the join-irreducible elements of Young's lattice~$Y$.

\probpart Let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\dots,\lambda_\ell)$ be a partition,
  and let $\lambda=\mu_1\join\mu_2\join\cdots\join\mu_k$ be the
  unique minimal decomposition of $\lambda$ into join-irreducibles.
  Explain how to find $k$ from the Ferrers diagram of $\lambda$.

\prob
\probpart Count the maximal chains in $L_n(q)$. (Recall that this is
the lattice of vector subspaces of $V=(\Ff_q)^n$, where $\Ff_q$
is the finite field with $q$ elements).

\probpart Count the maximal chains in the interval $[\0,\lambda]\subset Y$
if the Ferrers diagram of $\lambda$ is a $2\x n$ rectangle.

\probpart Ditto if $\lambda$ is a hook shape (i.e., $\lambda=(n+1,1,1,\dots,1)$,
with a total of $m$ copies of 1).

\prob Prove that the rank-generating function of Bruhat order on $\Sym_n$ is
\[\sum_{\sigma\in\Sym_n} q^{r(\sigma)} = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{1-q^i}{1-q}\]
where $r(\sigma)=\#\{\{i,j\} \st i<j~\text{and}~\sigma_i>\sigma_j\}$.
(Hint: Induct on $n$, and use one-line notation
for permutations, not cycle notation,.)

\prob
Fill in the details in the proof of Birkhoff's theorem by showing the following facts.

\probpart For a finite distributive lattice~$L$, show that the map $\phi:L\to J(\Irr(L))$
given by
  $$\phi(x) ~=~ \langle p \st p\in\Irr(L),\; p\leq x \rangle$$
is indeed a lattice isomorphism.

\probpart For a finite poset~$P$, show that an order ideal in $P$ is join-irreducible in
$J(P)$ if and only if it is principal (i.e., generated by a single element).
