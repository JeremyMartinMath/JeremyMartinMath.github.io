<ul>
<li><a href="honors3.pdf">Honors Project #3</a> is now available. (11/13 7:30 AM)
<li>You can raise your score on the second in-class test by <a 
  href="http://www.jlmartin.faculty.ku.edu/math141/Rover.pdf">redoing the last problem</a>.
  Follow the instructions on the linked PDF file.
  The absolute deadline for handing in the redo is Monday, November 12 at 11:00 AM,
  and you must not work with or consult any other person as you redo the problem.
(11/10 12:00 PM)
<li>Extra problems marked as
  &quot;Bonus&quot; (which are typically quite challenging) can now
  be turned in for extra credit at any time during the semester - they don't
  have to be turned in with the rest of the homework.  (This is to encourage you
  to work on these problems!)  Here is a <a href="extracredit.pdf">list of bonus
  problems</a>, which I'll keep up to date throughout the semester. (10/24 8:00 AM)

  On problems #22 and #24 from [5.2], your answer should resemble the calculation
  on p.358.  To evaluate the integral, represent it at a Riemann
  sum; simplfy it using the laws for sums on p.357; and calculate
  the limit as the number <i>n</i> of subdivisions tends to infinity.

<a name="honors"><h3>Honors Projects</h3></a>

<p>There will be three Honors Projects over the course of the semester.
The projects are mathematical writing assignments to be completed in
small groups (assigned by Prof. Martin).  Your work will be evaluated on 
the correctness of the mathematics,
the clarity of the writing, and the overall presentation.  In addition to
consulting Prof. Martin, you may wish to make an appointment with the
<a href="http://www.writing.ku.edu/">KU Writing Center</a> to discuss matters
of style and clarity.

<li><i>Unofficial letter grades:</i>
Roughly, 90-100 is an A, 80-89 is a B, 70-79 is a C,
55-69 is a D, and below that is an F.  Please note that these letter grades are
purely to give you an idea how you're doing so far, and will have no 
bearing on the final letter grade you earn.

<p>The second in-class test was given in class on Friday, November 9.  The test covered 
material up to and including section 5.2 of the textbook.  The main topics covered were 
related rates [Section 4.1]; maximum and minimum values [4.2]; graphing with and without 
silicon assistance [4.3, 4.4]; L'Hopital's Rule [4.5]; optimization problems [4.6]; 
antiderivatives [4.9]; areas, distances, and the basics of definite integrals [Sections 5.1, 
5.2]; and whatever material from earlier in the year is necessary for these problems.

<a name="gateway"><h3>Gateway Exam</h3></a>

<p>The Gateway Exam is an online exam that is designed to test (1) your 
familiarity with the technical rules of differentiation (mostly covered in 
Chapter 3 of the textbook) and (2) your ability to interact with 
technology in the context of mathematics.

<p>The exam consists of two parts: an unproctored preliminary exam that 
you can take from any computer with an Internet connection, and a 
proctored exam that you must take in the Gateway Lab, 159 Snow.  You must 
pass the preliminary exam before attempting the proctored exam.

<p>The Gateway Lab opens for all Math 121/141 students on <b>Tuesday, October 2</b>.
The deadline for passing the preliminary exam by <b>Monday, October 29</b>, and
the deadline for passing the proctored exam is <b>Monday, November 12</b>.

<ul>
<li><i>Statistics:</i> The mean and median scores were both 160/205, or about 78%.
<li><i>Unofficial letter grades:</i>
Approximately, 180-205 is an A, 155-179 is a B, 135-154 is a C,
