<a name="hw"><h3>Homework Assignments</h3></a>

<p>Here is the <a href="hw409.pdf">master problem list</a>,
which I will update frequently <b>(last update: (May 1)</b>.
I'll assign some of these as homework, and you'll work on some of them
in groups in class.  You can use the other ones for review.
I will be adding problems to the list as the semester progresses.

<p>Homework is due every Tuesday at 5:00 PM.  <b>No late homework will be accepted.</b>
If you have a conflict which prevents you from turning the homework in on time, let
me know <i>before the deadline</i>.

<p><u>Written assignments</u> should be submitted to me in class, left in my mailbox in
the Math Department office (405 Snow) or brought to my office (623 Snow).
When you write proofs, you should refer to the <a href="axioms.pdf">
master list of axioms,
definitions and theorems</a> (last updated 2/12/13), and cite (by
 number) every fact or
definition that you use.  Here is a  <a href="axioms-short.pdf">short list</a> with the same numbering, but no proofs --- just axioms and theorems.

<p><u><i>Sketchpad</i> assignments</u> should be e-mailed to me as attachments.  If you submit them early,
I will try to respond as quickly as possible so that you can fix mistakes.  You can
keep re-submitting sketches until the weekly deadline of Tuesday at 5 PM.
Here is the grading scale for <i>Sketchpad</i> assignments:
<ul>
<li>5/5: Construction works, and I can't mess it up no matter how hard I try
<li>4/5: Construction works in most cases, but after some effort, I found a way to mess it up
<li>3/5: Construction works in some cases, but I found an easy way to mess it up
<li>2/5: Construction doesn't work, but I think you've made partial progress toward a solution
<li>1/5: Construction doesn't work, and I don't see any partial progress
<li>0/5: No construction submitted
</ul>
<p>Re-submitting a sketch (before the deadline) can only increase your grade on it.

<p><b>Homework #1</b> (due Tuesday, January 29):
<ul>
<li>Purchase and install <a href="https://www.mheonline.com/program/view/2/16/2647/00000SPAD#program"><i>Geometer's
Sketchpad</i></a>.  Work through the <a href="GSPintro.pdf">introduction handout</a> to become familiar with what the software does.  (You don't need to turn anything in.)
<li>Ruler/compass constructions: RC 3, RC 9, RC 10.  Each construction
should be accompanied by an explanation of the steps you have
taken and why the construction works.
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> problems: SA 2, SA 3, SA 4.  For SA 2 and SA 3,
use only the Point, Circle and Line tools---do not use 
any of the shortcuts from the <b>Construct</b> or other menus.
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #2</b> (due Tuesday, February 5):
<ul>
<li>Read <a href="AxiomIntro.pdf">these notes on axiom systems</a>.
<li>Ruler/compass constructions: RC 6, RC 7, RC 8.  Each construction
should be accompanied by an explanation of the steps you have
taken and why the construction works.
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> problems: SA 6, SA 7, SA 8.  Do not use any of
the circle or arc constructions from the <b>Construct</b> menu.

</ul>
<p><b>Homework #3</b> (due Tuesday, February 12):
<ul>
<li>Euclidean geometry proofs: EG 6, EG 11.
When you write proofs, you should refer to the <a href="axioms.pdf">
master list of axioms,
definitions and theorems</a>, and cite (by number) every fact or
definition that you use.
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> constructions: SA 10, SA 11, SA 12.
It is now officially OK to use the <b>Construct</b> menu.
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #4</b> (due Tuesday, February 19):
<ul>
<li>Euclidean geometry proofs: EG 8, EG 14.
Again, you should refer to the <a href="axioms.pdf">
master list of axioms,
definitions and theorems</a>, and cite (by number) every fact or
definition that you use.
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> constructions: SA 18, SA 20.<br>
<b><a href="sa18.txt">Note on SA18 (2/17/13)</a></b>
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #5</b> (due Tuesday, February 26):
<ul>
<li><s>Euclidean geometry proofs: EG 19, EG 20.</s> (<i>Postponed until 3/5</i>)<br>
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> constructions: SA 21, SA 24.
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #6</b> (due Tuesday, March 5):
<ul>
<li>Euclidean geometry proofs: EG 19, EG 20.<br>
(Be sure to obtain the <b>new versions</b> of the axioms and homework
problems, updated 2/18/13.)
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #7</b> (due Tuesday, March 12):
<ul>
<li>Euclidean geometry proofs: EG 21, EG 22, EG 23.  (This last one should look familiar!  This is the promised redo --- if you write a careful proof with all steps justified and earn full credit, then you'll also get retroactive full credit on SA11.)
<li><i>Sketchpad</i> construction: SA 22.  (This doesn't have much to do with things we've been talking about --- but it is really neat.)
</ul>

<p>Homework #8 (due Tuesday, April 2):
<ul>
<li>Written problems: TG 1, TG 2, TG 3, TG 4, TG 5.
Be sure to obtain the <a href="hw409.pdf">latest revision of the master problem list</a>.
The <a href="trans.pdf">notes on transformational geometry</a> will be 
helpful.  For TG 3 and TG 4, your answer should use the
<a href="quickref.pdf">standard  notation for transformations</a>.<br>
<i>Clarification on TG 1 and TG 2:</i> You only have to list
transformations that are isometries.
</ul>

<p>Homework #9 (due Tuesday, April 9):
<ul>
<li>Written problems: TG 6, TG 8, TG 9.
</ul>

<p>Homework #10 (due Thursday, April 18):
<ul>
<li>Written problems: TG 11, TG 12, TG 13.
</ul>

<p>Homework #11 (due Tuesday, April 30):
<ul>
<li>Written problems: TG 20, PH 1, PH 2.  Extra credit: TG 17.
You may want to consult the <a href="polyhedra.pdf">notes on polyhedra</a>.
</ul>

<p><b>Homework #12 (due Thursday, May 9):</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Written problems: TG 21, PH 3, PH 4.</b>
(Note that PH4 has been updated as of May 1.)
</ul>
