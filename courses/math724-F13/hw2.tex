Extra credit (based on a problem in Bona): Let $P<Q$ be positive integers.  The students in a class are assigned to $P$ groups for in-class group work.  (Each group has at least one student in it.)  One day a substitute teacher comes in and rearranges the students into $Q$ groups.  Prove that at least $Q-P+1$ students end up in smaller groups.
