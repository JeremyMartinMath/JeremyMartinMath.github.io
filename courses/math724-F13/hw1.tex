{\bf Math 724, Fall 2013\\
Homework \#1

\bf Instructions:} Write up your solutions in LaTeX and hand in a hard copy in class on {\bf Friday, September~6.}  Collaboration is allowed (and in fact encouraged), but each student must write up his or her solutions independently and acknowledge all collaborators.

(\#1) Problem \#13.%(p.7)

(\#2) Problem \#19.%(p.8)

(\#3) Problem \#20.%(p.9)

(\#4) Chapter 1 Supplementary Problem \#1.%(p.30)

(\#5) Chapter 1 Supplementary Problem \#2.%(p.30)

(\#6) Chapter 1 Supplementary Problem \#8.%(p.31)

(\#7)
Let $a_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}^2$. Calculate $a_n$ for $0\leq n\leq 3$.  Stare at Pascal's triangle and make a conjecture about the value of $a_n$.  If you like, use Sage or another computer algebra system to check that your conjecture works for a few more values of $n$. Prove your conjecture using a bijection.  (There may be a proof by induction, but it's probably disgusting.)
