<a name="hw"><h3>Homework Assignments</h3></a>

<p>Homework problems fall into three categories: Required,
Honors and Practice.

<p>Required and practice problems will typically be standard calculus
problems from the textbook.  Hand in only the required problems.
The practice problems are ones that I think are especially helpful
for studying, but you should not hand in solutions as part of
the weekly homework assignments (of course, it's OK to
ask me about them).

<p>The Honors problems will typically be more challenging, wide-ranging
or open-ended than the other problems.  You can accumulate up to
50 points worth of points on the Honors problems; I'll try to
assign about 6-8 points worth of Honors problems each week,
so to some extent you can choose which problems to do based on
your personal taste.

<p>Please turn in the Honors problems separately from the Required problems.

<h4>All assignments are subject to change until
one week before the posted due date. </h4>
