<a name="hw"><h3>Homework Assignments</h3></a>

<p>Homework is due at 5:00 PM every Tuesday (except days after midterm tests),
starting January 30.
This makes a total of 12 homework assignments; your two lowest
scores (including assignments not turned in) will be dropped.
Only turn in the required problems.  Not every problem will necessarily be graded,
but part of your homework score will be for doing all the assigned problems.
The homework is worth 20% of your grade.
You can turn in homework in class, leave it in
my mailbox in the Math Department office, 405 Snow, or 
bring it to my office, 541 Snow (if I am not around, you can leave it
in the wall box or slip it under my door).
Your homework should be as neat and legible
as if it were typed, and all sheets should be stapled together.

<p>Turn in only the problems marked
&quot;Required&quot;.  The problems marked &quot;Practice&quot;
are mostly drill-type problems and/or similar to one of the
required problems, and are not to be turned in.

<p>Each week, I'll choose four or five problems from the 
&quot;Required&quot; list to be graded for correctness and clarity. About 
three-quarters of your homework grade will be based on those problems; the 
remaining one-quarter will be based on completeness -- that is, making at 
least a reasonable attempt to solve each of the required problems.

<p>
<i>Homework turned in late will not be accepted.<br>
Additional problems may be added up to one week before the due date.</i>

<a name="tests"><h3>Tests</h3></a>

<p>There will be a 30-minute <u>quiz</u> in class on
<b>Tuesday, February 6</b>, worth 10% of your grade.  
The quiz will cover material from Chapter 1 of the textbook.
This is intended partly as a diagnostic, to give you some idea
of how you're doing before the first drop date.

<p>There will be two <u>in-class tests</u> on <b>Thursday, March 1</b> and
<b>Thursday, April 12</b>.  Each test is worth 20% of your final grade.
Some or all of the Tuesday before each test will be devoted to
a review session.

<p><b>Test #1</b>
<ul>
<li>Date/time: <b>Thursday, March 1</b>, in class
<li><a href="review1.pdf">Review information</a>
<li>The mean score was 111/200 and the median was 112/200.  Approximate letter grades
  are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li> A: 144--200
  <li> B: 112--143
  <li> C: 80--111
  <li> D: 60--79
  <li> F: &lt;60
  </ul>
<i>Note:</i> This is not necessarily the same scale that will 
be used in calculating final letter grades.
</ul>

<p><b>Test #2</b>
<ul>
<li>Date/time: <b>Thursday, April 12</b>, in class
<li><a href="review2.html">Review information</a>
<li>The mean score was 147/200 and the median was 159/200.  Approximate letter grades
  are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li> A: 180--200
  <li> B: 160--179
  <li> C: 140--159
  <li> D: 110--139
  <li> F: &lt;110
  </ul>
<i>Note:</i> This is not necessarily the same scale that will 
be used in calculating final letter grades.
</ul>

<p><hr> <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="final"><h3>Final Exam</h3></a>

<p>The final exam is scheduled for <b>Friday, May 18, 
10:30 AM--1:00 PM, Snow 301</b>.  The exam will cover the entire
semester's worth of material, with emphasis on the material not
covered on the two midterm tests (starting approximately
with Section 5.4).  The exam is worth 30% of your final grade.

<p>Here is a <a href="review-final.pdf">review handout</a>, 
including lists of practice problems.

<p>Review sessions:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Tuesday, May 15, 1:00--2:30 PM, Snow 306.</b> (&quot;If you were 
writing a Math 223 final exam, what would you put on it?&quot;)
  <li><b>Wednesday, May 16, 12:30--2:00 PM, Snow 306.</b> (This 
will be a Q&amp;A session: you bring the Q's, I'll supply the A's.)
  </ul>
I will also hold office hours on <b>Thursday, May 17</b>, from 1:00--4:30 
PM in Snow 541.

<p>The average score on the final exam was 209/300 (70%) and the median was 213/300
(71%).  Contact the instructor for more information.
