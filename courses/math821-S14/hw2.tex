\prob (Hatcher, p.19, \#12)
Show that a homotopy equivalence $f:X\to Y$ induces a bijection 
between the set of path-components of~$X$ and the set of path-components 
of~$Y$, and that~$f$ restricts to a homotopy equivalence from each 
path-component of~$X$ to the corresponding path-component of~$Y$. Prove 
also the corresponding statements with components instead of 
path-components. Deduce that if the components of a space~$X$ coincide 
with its path-components, then the same holds for any space~$Y$ that is homotopy-equivalent to $X$.

\prob Let $p$ and $q$ be two distinct points on $S^2$, and let $X$ be the space obtained by gluing
them together.  Show that $X$ is homotopy-equivalent to a wedge of spheres, and determine its exact homotopy type.

\prob For $n\geq 1$, let $T_n$ denote the $n$-holed torus.  Construct a cell complex structure on $T_n$.  (You can do this by a picture.)

\prob (Hatcher, p.20, \#22) Let $X$ be a finite graph lying in a half-plane $P\subset\Rr^3$ and intersecting the
edge $e$ of $P$ in a subset of its vertices.  (See example below.)  Describe the homotopy type of the ``surface of revolution''
obtained by rotating $X$ about $e$.

\prob Let $0\leq k\leq n$.
Recall from class that the \emph{Grassmannian} $G(k,n)$
is defined as the space of $k$-dimensional subspaces $V\subset\Rr^n$,
so that in particular, $G(1,\Rr^n)=\Rr P^{n-1}$.  (Fact: Everything in
this problem works the same way if you change $\Rr$ to $\Cc$, except
that the dimensions of all the cells get doubled.)

\probpart Work out an explicit cell decomposition for $G(2,4)$
as a finite CW-complex.  That is,
describe how to decompose the set $G(2,4)$ into pieces, each of which is
isomorphic to a $\Rr$-vector space.
If you do this correctly (hint: row-reduced echelon form),
then the isomorphisms should be straightforward from the construction.

\probpart Describe the attaching poset of $G(2,4)$.  (This
is the partially ordered
set whose elements are the cells $e_\alpha$, and whose order
relation is given by $e_\alpha\geq e_\beta$ if
$\overline{e_\alpha}\supseteq e_\beta$).

\probpart Describe the attaching poset of $G(2,5)$.

\probpart A \emph{Ferrers diagram} is a collection of square boxes that
are top- and right-justified: for instance,
\begin{center}
\yng(6,6,4,3,1)
\end{center}
Write out the poset $P(2,3)$ of all Ferrers diagrams with at most two 
rows and at most three columns, ordered by containment (as sets of 
squares).  Compare it to your previous answer.

\prob [{\bf Extra credit}]  [Hatcher p.19, \#20] Show that the subspace $X\subset\Rr^3$ formed by a Klein bottle intersecting itself in a circle, as shown in the figure on p.19 of Hatcher, is homotopy equivalent to $X^1\vee X^1\vee S^2$.  (Note: This is extra credit because currently I don't know how to do it.  I'm hoping someone can show me.)
