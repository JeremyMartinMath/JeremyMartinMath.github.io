\prob The \emph{dunce hat} is the space $D$ obtained from a triangle
by identifying all three edges with each other, with the orientations
indicated below.

\probpart  Prove that $D$ is simply-connected using Van Kampen's theorem.\\
\probpart  Find a different, one-line proof that $D$ is simply-connected.

\prob Consider the standard picture of the torus $T=S^1\x S^1$
as a quotient space of the square.  Explain what is wrong with the following ``proof''
(whose conclusion is certainly false):

\begin{quotation}
\emph{Consider the open cover $A_\alpha\cup A_\beta\cup A_\gamma$ shown below.
Each open set in the cover is path-connected and simply-connected, and their intersection is path-connected.
Therefore, by Van Kampen's theorem, the torus is simply-connected.}
\end{quotation}

\prob (Hatcher, p.53, \#4, modified) Let $n\geq 1$ be an integer, and 
let $X\subset\Rr^3$ be the union of $n$ distinct rays emanating from the 
origin.  Compute $\pi_1(\Rr^3\sm X)$.

\prob Let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be nonzero integers.  
Construct a cell complex $X$ from $S^1$ as follows:
For each $j=1,\dots,n$, attach a $2$-cell to $S^1$ by wrapping
it around the circle $a_j$ times.  What is $\pi_1(X)$?

\prob (Hatcher, p.53, \#6, modified) Let $X$ be a path-connected cell 
complex, and let $Y$ be a cell complex obtained from $X$ by attaching an 
$n$-cell for some $n\geq 3$.  Show that the inclusion $X\inj Y$ induces 
an isomorphism $\pi_1(X)\isom\pi_1(Y)$.

\prob (Hatcher p.79, \#2) Show that if $p_1:\tilde X_1\to X_1$ and $p_2:\tilde X_2\to X_2$ are covering spaces, then so is their product $p_1\x p_2:\tilde X_1\x\tilde X_2\to X_1\x X_2$.

%\prob (Hatcher p.79, \#10) FInd all the connected 2-sheeted and 3-sheeted covering spaces of $S^1\wedge S^1$, up to isomorphism of covering spaces without basepoints.

\prob (Hatcher p.80, \#12) Let $a$ and $b$ be the generators of $\pi_1(S^1\vee S^1,x_0)$ corresponding to the two copies of $S^1$, with $x_0$ their common point.  Draw a picture of the covering space $\tilde X$ of $S^1\vee S^1$ corresponding to the normal subgroup of $\pi_1(S^1\vee S^1)$ generated by $a^2$, $b^2$, and $(ab)^4$, and prove that this covering space is indeed the correct one.  (I.e., this group should be $p_*\pi_1(\tilde X,\tilde x_0)$.)
