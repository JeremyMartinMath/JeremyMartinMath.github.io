<p>You can refer to this problem as &quot;Problem N&quot; on your homework.

<p>If you are having problems viewing the HTML below, the problem
is <a href="ProblemN.pdf">also available as a PDF file</a>.

<p>1. Plot the graphs of the equations
\(x^2+xy-y^3=2\) and \(x^3+2y^2+9=0\).
(You should get two curves that intersect in a unique point \(P\).)

<p>2. Look at the graphs to make a reasonable first guess \((x_0,y_0)\)
for \(P\).

<p>3. Use Newton's Method to find successive approximations \((x_1,y_1)\)
and \((x_2,y_2)\) to \(P\).
