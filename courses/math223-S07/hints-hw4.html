<h3>Hints on HW #3</h3>

<h4>Problem #50 from 2.3</h4>

<p>Once you have done part (b), you will suspect that the answer to (c) is
"No, they can't possibly exist," because plugging (x,y)=(0,0) into the
partial derivatives you found in part (b) will give something undefined.

<p>However, the partial derivatives <u>do</u> exist at (0,0), for a subtle reason.
Remember that the partial derivative with respect to x is defined as the
derivative of the partial function with respect to x.  So you can find the
value of the partial derivative f<sub>x</sub> at (0,0) by calculating

<p>lim<sub>x &rarr; 0</sub>  [ f(x,0)-f(0,0) ] / x.

<p>It may help to look at the <a href="cuberoot.jpg">graph of the surface</a>,
either by itself or <a href="cuberoot2.jpg">intersected with the plane y=0</a>.

<h4>Problem #28 from 2.5</h4>

<p>This problem is really about implicit differentiation in the multivariable
setting.  Remember that in Math 121, if you have an equation f(x,y)=0,
you could find dy/dx implicitly by differentiating both sides with
respect to x (treating y not as a constant, but as a function of x) and
then solving for dy/dx.

<p>You can do the same thing in this problem: start by differentiating both sides of the
equation using the Chain Rule.
