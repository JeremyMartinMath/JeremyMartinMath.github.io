The answer to your question may also be on this page:


<p><a name="mml-hw"><b>How do I do homework assignments in MyMathLab?</b></a><br>

<p>Log on to MyMathLab and click on the &quot;HOMEWORK&quot; button at 
the left side of the screen.  A new tab will open with a list of 
assignments and due dates, with the current assignment last.  Click on 
the name of the assignment (e.g., &quot;Homework #2&quot;) to start 
working.

<p>If the homework assignments don't show up, and you see a link on the
left side of the page that says &quot;Math 105, Fall 2011&quot;, click on it.
If you don't see it, try refreshing the page
or logging out and logging back in.

<p><a name="mml-redo"><b>If I get an answer wrong, can I redo the problem?</b></a><br>

<p>Yes, you can redo the same or a similar problem.
The list of problem numbers at the top of the homework screen
tells you which problems you haven't received full credit on yet.
Clicking on a problem you've already done will give you the same
or a similar problem, which you can attempt again to raise your
score.

<p>For problems with only a few possible answers (like multiple-choice
and true-false questions), you may get a limited number of tries
(otherwise, it would be possible to get credit simply by repeated
blind guessing).  However, you can always go back to the problem
and ask the system for a similar problem.

<p><a name="mml-after"><b>Can I redo problems for practice after the due date?</b></a><br>

<p>Yes.  From the main MML menu, click on "Gradebook", then "Entire
course to date."  Each homework assignment will have a link marked
"Review."  Click on that to redo the problems for practice.  If it's
after the due date, your grade will not change.  The &quot;Do Similar
Problem&quot; feature is also still available --- this is a great way
to study for tests.

<p><a name="mml-grades"><b>How do I check my grades in MyMathLab?</b></a><br>

<p>Log on to MyMathLab and click on the &quot;GRADEBOOK&quot; button at 
the left side of the screen.  A new tab will open with a list of 
assignments, due dates, and the grades you received.

<p>If you click on the &quot;Show Overall Score&quot; button at the top of the Gradebook,
it will give you a rough estimate of how you are doing so far. The 
later in the semester, the more accurate this estimate tends to be. To 
convert the overall score to a letter grade, us a standard scale (90-100 
= A, 80-89 = B, etc.)

<p><a name="mml-book"><b>How do I use the electronic version of the textbook?</b></a><br>

<p>Log on to MyMathLab and click on the &quot;eBook&quot; button at 
the left side of the screen.

<p><a name="mml-help"><b>I need help with my homework.</b></a><br>

<p>You have several options:
<ul>
  <li>MyMathLab includes many inline help resources (the &quot;Help Me 
Solve This,&quot; &quot;View an Example,&quot; &quot;Textbook&quot; and 
&quot;Calculator&quot; buttons on the right side of the screen.  Try 
these and see if they work for you.
  <li>Find another student to work with.  This is especially helpful if 
you try to &quot;think out loud&quot;: describe to the other person what 
you think the problem is about, what you know, and where you are getting 
stuck.  
  <li>Go to the <a href="helproom.html"><b>Help Room, Snow 151</b></a>, which is open 10-5 on weekdays
(except during class and Prof. Martin's office hours.)
  <li>Go to Prof. Martin's office hours (Tuesdays, 9-11 AM, Snow 623).
  <li>You can send e-mail to <a 
href="mailto:math105-f11@math.ku.edu">math105-f11@math.ku.edu</a>.  (You 
may not get an instant response, and it can be harder to communicate 
over e-mail than in person --- but we'll do our best.)
</ul>

<p><a name="mml-tech"><b>I need technical help with MyMathLab.</b></a><br>

<p>If you need immediate technical help, Pearson has a 24-hour support line at
<b>1-800-677-6337</b>.  (Note that Pearson does not provide help with
the homework problems themselves!)  You can
also <a href="http://247xl.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch/">text chat
live with</a>
or <a href="http://247xl.custhelp.com/app/ask">e-mail</a> a Pearson
representative.  In all cases, you may have to be patient (a typical
wait time on the live chat is 15 minutes).
You may also want to check <a href="http://www.mymathlab.com/contactus_stu.html">Pearson's technical FAQ</a>.

<p>If there is a recurring problem, please let us know by e-mail
at <a href="mailto:math105-f11@math.ku.edu">math105-f11@math.ku.edu</a>,
although we may not be able to solve the problem immediately.

<p><a name="mml-late"><b>I turned in the homework on time but the system told me it was late.</b></a><br>

<p>MyMathLab is accurate about timestamps.  Check that your time zone is 
set correctly, and make sure to submit your homework well before the 
weekly deadline (Wednesday evening, 11:59 PM).

<p>If you encounter a problem submitting your homework before the 
deadline, send an e-mail to <a 
href="mailto:math105-f11@math.ku.edu">math105-f11@math.ku.edu</a> 
describing the problem, and call Pearson at 1-800-677-6337 for immediate 
technical support.

<p><a name="mml-bb"><b>Why can't we use the KU Blackboard site?</b></a><br>

<p>A fair question.  A lot of the material on the MyMathLab site comes from the
textbook, so it's owned by the publisher (Pearson) and isn't currently
available through Blackboard.  The cost of the course packet
(custom textbook + MyMathLab access) is approximately the same as that
of a standard textbook.

<p><a name="mml-reg"><b>How do I register on the MyMathLab website?</b></a><br>

<p>
The course packet available at the KU Bookstore includes an access 
code for MyMathLab.  Once you have the course packet, go to the <a 
href="http://www.mymathlab.com">MyMathLab website</a> to register.
<a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~math105-f11/MML-GettingStarted.pdf">Here are instructions
for registering.</a>  You will need the following information:
<ul>
<li>A student access code (provided with the course packet available at the KU Bookstore)
<li>The Course ID, which is <b>martin72146</b>
<li>KU's zip code, which is <b>66045</b>
<li>A valid e-mail address (which should be the same one you use for Enroll & Pay) 
</ul>
Make sure you register with the same first name, last name, and 
e-mail address that you use on Enroll &amp; Pay; otherwise, your 
grades may not be recorded properly!

<p><a name="mml-cc"><b>What's the difference between MyMathLab and CourseCompass?</b></a><br>

<p>There isn't any.  Some older Pearson materials refer to CourseCompass instead of MyMathLab.
It's the same system.

<p><a name="mml-book"><b>Can I purchase a MyMathLab subscription
without buying the textbook?</b></a><br>

<p>Yes.  Go to <a href="http://www.mymathlab.com">mymathlab.com</a>,
enter the course ID (martin72146), and purchase an access code using a
credit card.  They will charge you $80 (as opposed to the textbook
plus access code, which is $104 at the Bookstore).  The MyMathLab
subscription does include an online version of the textbook, so either
way is fine.

<p>Alternately, if you plan to buy the book later, then MyMathLab has
an option for you to register temporarily without paying.  I'm not
sure exactly where it happens in the registration process, but at some
point, you will have the option of signing up for 17 days of free
registration.  If you choose that option, then you will be able to
sign on and work on the homework assignments, and you can enter the
access code when you get it from the KU Bookstore.


<p><hr> <!-- ------------------------------------------------------>
<a name="enroll"><h3>Enrollment/Registration</h3></a>

<p><a name="enroll-right"><b>Is Math 105 the right course for me?</b></a><br>

<p>Math 105
fulfills <a href="http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/degree-requirements253#05">
the second-level requirement for B.A. and B.G.S. degrees in the
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences</a>.  The prerequisite is Math
101 (College Algebra) or Math 104 (Precalculus), or 2 years of high
school algebra and a score of 26 or more on Enhanced ACT Mathematics,
or a qualifying score on
the <a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/academics/undergraduate/placement_dates.html">Mathematics
Department placement test</a>.  For questions about placement, consult
the Mathematics Department
Advisor, <a href="mailto:ldeaver@math.ku.edu">Lindsey Deaver</a>, or
your own departmental advisor.

<p><a name="enroll-late"><b>Can I add the course late?</b></a><br>

<p>The last date that you can enroll without the instructor's
permission is Friday, August 26.  In general, the only reason for an
exception is that you intend to take the course but are unable to
enroll in time (e.g., because of a enrollment hold).  In that case,
you should:
<ol>
<li>notify both <a href="mailto:ldeaver@math.ku.edu">Lindsey
Deaver</a> (Mathematics Department
Advisor) and <a href="math105-f11@math.ku.edu">Prof. Martin</a>
of your situation;
<li>attend lectures, register for the course on MyMathLab, and
complete the homework assignments while you are waiting for the hold
to be lifted;
<li>enroll as soon as possible.
</ol>
The last day the Registrar will permit you to add a class is Monday, September 19.
This deadline cannot be changed by individual instructors.

<p><a name="enroll3-section"><b>There are two sections of Math 105 listed on the Registrar's site.  Which is which?</b></a>

<p>Prof. Martin's KU course ID is 13988.  If you are on campus and you are coming to Budig 120, this is the course you should be enrolled in.  Double-check the instructor's name and KU course ID number.

<p><a name="enroll-adddrop"><b>What are the Add/Drop dates?</b></a><br>

<p>The authority on this is the <a 
href="http://www.registrar.ku.edu">Registrar's Office</a>, specifically 
the <a 
href="http://www.registrar.ku.edu/~registr/pdf/enrollment/calendar_date_4119.pdf">official 
KU academic calendar</a>.<br>
<ul>
<li>The last day to add/drop sections online is Friday, August 26.<br>
<li>First Period Drop ends on Monday, September 12.<br>
<li>The last day to add a class is Monday, September 19.<br>
<li>Second Period Drop ends on Wednesday, November 16.
</ul>

<p><a name="enroll-email"><b>Why am I not getting announcements by e-mail?</b></a><br>

<p>E-mail announcements go to a list that is automatically generated
from students' registered KU e-mail addresses.  You can confirm that 
you are on the course mailing list <a href="https://www.aims.ku.edu/groups/groups.shtml">here</a>.
If you don't see the Math 105 mailing list on your
subscriptions, <a href="http://www.email.ku.edu/dlists/primer.shtml#method_2">make
sure that your KU e-mail address is registered</a>.  If that still
doesn't work, contact <a mailto:dlist@mail.ku.edu>KU Information Technology</a> for help.


<hr> <!-- ------------------------------------------------------>
<a name="test"><h3>Tests and Exams</h3></a>

<p><a name="test-study"><b>How do I study for tests?</b></a><br>

<p>Do problems, do problems, do problems!
<ul>
<li>You can redo homework
problems and similar problems on MyMathLab --- your score won't change
if the deadline has passed, but the problems themselves are always
available (go to the &quot;Gradebook&quot; section of MML, then use the
&quot;Review*quot; links next to each assignment).
<li>Sample test problems are 
available on the &quot;Test Problems&quot; section of MyMathLab.
<i>Working on the practice problems will not affect your grade.</i>
(Even though MML thinks the problems are a "quiz", I will not see the "grade" that MML gives you, and it will not affect your actual grade in Math 105.)
<li>
The textbook has lots more exercises (labelled &quot;Walking,&quot; 
&quot;Jogging,&quot; and &quot;Running&quot; in increasing order of 
difficulty). For many topics, you can try making up your own problems!
For example, if you are studying Chapter 2, you can make up your
own weighted voting system and calculate the Banzhaf 
and Shapley-Shubik distributions yourself, then try to convince a 
friend that you have the right answer.
</ul>

<p><a name="test-aid">What aids are permitted on tests?</b></a><br>

<p>You may use a <a href="misc-calc">calculator</a>, but no other aids.  In
particular, <b>all cell phones must be turned off during tests</b>.

<p><a name="test-seat"><b>How do I find out my assigned seat for the tests?</b></a><br>

<p>Assigned seats are available through MyMathLab; click on the
&quot;SEAT ASSIGNMENT&quot; button from the home screen.  (MyMathLab
thinks the seat assignment is a grade, but just ignore that.)  Here is a
<a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~math105-f11/Budig120.pdf">seating map of Budig 120</a>.  Single-letter seats are on the bottom floor, AA through MM are the side sections and the two rows on the balcony, and NN through VV are higher up.

<p><a name="test-makeup"><b>I will not be able to attend class on the date of an exam.  Can I schedule a makeup?</b></a><br>

<p>Yes.  E-mail <a 
href="mailto:math105-f11@math.ku.edu">math105-f11@math.ku.edu</a>
<u>as soon as you find out about the conflict.</u>  I will work with you
to arrange a makeup test as soon as possible <b>after</b> the date of the exam.
The makeup will be comparable in scope and difficulty to the regular exam.
In general, I will assume that you are telling the truth about
family or medical emergencies, but I reserve the right to ask
you to provide appropriate documentation.

<p><a name="test-missed"><b>I missed the last exam.  Can I schedule a makeup?</b></a><br>

<p>As a rule, no.  Makeup tests are only for the purpose of accommodating
schedule conflicts of which you inform the instructor <b>in
advance</b>.  If you have a legitimate, <b>documentable</b> emergency that
prevented you from taking the test, contact me as soon as possible.

<hr> <!-- ------------------------------------------------------>
<a name="misc"><h3>Miscellaneous</h3></a>

<p><a name="misc-calc"><b>Do I need a calculator?</b></a><br>

<p>Calculators are allowed on the tests, but not required.
Any model you have should be okay, since you will only need it
for arithmetic (for example, you won't need graphing capabilities).
The KU Bookstore sells simple calculators for under $10.

<p><a name="misc-used"><b>Can I save money by buying a used copy of the textbook?</b></a><br>

<p>Maybe.  The MyMathLab subscription costs $80 by itself.
The Bookstore's package (custom edition of the textbook plus MyMathLab access) costs $104.  Therefore, if you can't find a copy of Tannenbaum (7th edition) for $24 or less, your cheapest option is the course packet at the Bookstore.

<p><a name="misc-ec"><b>Can I get extra credit?</b></a><br>

<p>Yes, there is an <a href="extracredit.pdf">extra-credit assignment</a>,
that requires some independent work.  The deadline for submission is
11:59 PM on December 8 (the last day of classes). 

<li><a name="misc-miss"><b>What happens if I miss class?</b></a><br>

<p>If you will not be in class on an exam day, inform me (Prof. Martin)
<b>in advance</b> to make appropriate arrangements (see <a href="test-makeup">above</a>).
For a regular lecture day, you do not have to inform me of your absence.

<li><a name="misc-note"><b>Are lecture notes available online?</b></a><br>

<p>I will post the overhead &quot;slides&quot; on the main website as I
create them.  I don't recommend that you use the slides instead of
coming to class, but if something goes by too fast in lecture then you
can use the slides to fill in the gaps.  The slides are also a
resource for material I discuss in lecture that isn't in the textbook.
(By the way, the MyMathLab site includes a set of PowerPoint slides,
but I won't be using these.)

<p>Currently, the slides are not available from MyMathLab, just the course website.

<p>Do not repost the slides to any other part of the Internet ---
they are for your private use only.

<li><a name="#misc-announce"><b>Can I make an announcement to the whole class?</b></a>

<p>I permit <i>some</i> announcements, <i>at my discretion.</i>  You
must clear the announcement with me first, you must finish making
your announcement before class starts at 3:00 PM, and you may not use
class time to distribute or collect anything.  I do not permit
announcements that are in any way political (e.g., candidates for
student office, or political advocacy groups).  As a general rule, I
will permit announcements of campus events open to all students.
My granting permission for an announcement should not
be construed as any kind of endorsement.

<li><a href="#misc-tutor">Can you recommend a private tutor?</a>

<p>Before considering a private tutor, visit the <b>Help Room</b> in
Snow 151.  At least one TA is in there at almost all times from 10-5
on weekdays (and I drop by when I can); here is
the <a href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~math105-f11/helproom.html">complete
schedule.  The TAs are there for the express purpose of helping
students with homework problems --- think of them as tutors you've
already paid for with your tuition dollars.

<p>If you are still looking for a private tutor, you may contact me
individually.  The Math Department does not officially maintain a list
of tutors, but sometimes tutors will post flyers near the
undergraduate lounge on the third floor of Snow Hall.
