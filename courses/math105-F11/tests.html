<h2>Math 105 (Topics in Mathematics)<br>
Fall 2011<br>
Test Policies</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Scheduling</h3>

<p>In-class test dates are
<b>Friday 9/23</b>,
<b>Monday 10/24</b>, and
<b>Monday 11/21</b>.  The final exam will be given on 
<b>Tuesday 12/13</b>, from 1:30-4:00 PM.  All tests will be given in Budig 120.

<p>If you have a legitimate conflict with one of the test dates, notify
Prof. Martin <b>in advance and in writing</b> to schedule a makeup.
Makeups will always be given <b>after</b> the regularly scheduled exam date.

<h3>Coverage and Studying</h3>

The tests will cover the following sections of Tannenbaum's textbook:
<ul>
<li>Test #1 (9/23): Chapter 1 (everything except pp. 24-26);
  Chapter 2 (everything)
<li>Test #2 (10/24): Chapter 3 (sections 1,2,3,6,7);
  Chapter 5 (sections 1-6)
<li>Test #3 (11/21): Chapter 6 (everything); Chapter 7 (sections 1-3).
(You are not responsible for the "Mini-Excursion" section.)
<li>Final Exam (12/13): TBA
</ul>
<p>You are
responsible for material covered on the homework problems and
in lectures.  <b>The best way to study is to do problems!</b>
MyMathLab is an excellent tool for studying:
in addition to reviewing homework assignments and doing similar exercises,
a large list of sample test problems is available.  (Note: You can
ignore any "grade" MyMathLab gives you on the sample test problems --- I will
not see it and it will not affect your grade in the course.)


<h3>Test Procedure and Policies</h3>

<p>
<b>Seats are assigned randomly.</b>  You should have received an e-mail
with your seat assignment.  You can also find your
assigned seat, go to MyMathLab and click the
&quot;SEAT ASSIGNMENT&quot; button.  You must sit
in your assigned seat.  Refer to this
<a href="Budig120.pdf">seat map of Budig 120</a> and/or
find your assigned seat in advance.  If you do not have
an assigned seat, please contact math105-f11@math.ku.edu.

<p>
<b>You should bring:</b>
<ul>
<li>A #2 pencil
<li>Your KU ID card (<i>we will check IDs</i>)
<li>Calculator (optional).  Two students may not share a calculator,
and we will not have calculators to lend.
</ul>

<p><b>No other aids are permitted.</b>
In particular, all cell phones must be silenced and put away.

<p><b>No one may leave the room during the last 15 minutes</b>
(to avoid distracting others who are still working).
We will collect all tests at 3:50 PM.

<p><b>There will be multiple versions of the test.</b>
Each will be of equivalent difficulty, but with different problems.

<p>Here's what the <b><a href="cover-sheet.pdf">test cover sheet</a></b> looks like.
