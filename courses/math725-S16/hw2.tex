\prob Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected graph, let $T,T'\in\TT(G)$, and let $e\in T\sm T'$.  Prove that there exists an edge $e'\in T'\sm T$ such that both $T-e+e'$ and $T'+e-e'$ are spanning trees.  (This is known as the ``symmetric exchange law.'')

\prob\probpart Let $k\geq 2$ and let $G$ be a $k$-regular bipartite graph.  Prove that $G$ has no cut-edge. (Hint: Use the bipartite version of handshaking.)\paddown\\
\probpart Construct a simple, connected, nonbipartite $3$-regular graph with a cut-edge.  (This shows that the condition ``bipartite'' really
is necessary in (a).)

\prob Let $L_n$ be the graph obtained from $K_n$ by deleting one edge.  Determine $\tau(L_n)$.  (Hint: Use Cayley's formula as a starting point.)

\prob Let $F_n$ be the graph obtained from $P_n$ by adding a new vertex adjacent to every vertex of~$P_n$.  %(The letter $F$ stands for ``fan.'')
For example, $F_1\isom P_2$, $F_2\isom K_3$, and $F_3\isom L_4$ (as in the previous problem), and $F_6$ is shown below.
\includefigure{1.8in}{0.6in}{Fan6}
Let $a_n=\tau(F_n)$.  Use deletion/contraction to prove that $a_n=3a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}$ for $n\geq 3$.  See if you can recognize the sequence $a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4\dots$

\prob
Let $K_{p,q}$ denote the complete bipartite graph with partite sets of sizes $p$ and $q$.  Use the Matrix-Tree Theorem to calculate $\tau(K_{p,q})$.  (Suggestion: Find an explicit basis for $\Rr^{p+q}$ consisting of eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix $L(K_{p,q})$.)

\prob Let $G$ be a connected graph with weight function $w:E(G)\to\Rr_{\geq0}$.\paddown\\
\probpart  Suppose that $C\subseteq G$ is a cycle and $e\in C$ is an edge of maximum weight (i.e., $w(e)\geq w(e')$ for all $e'\in C$).  Prove
that $G$ has an MST not containing $e$.\paddown\\
\probpart Use (a) to show that the following algorithm produces an MST for all $G$ and $w$:

\yellpar{Let $T$ := $G$\\
while $T$ contains a cycle do:\\
\indnt\indnt Let $C$ be a cycle\\
\indnt\indnt Let $e$ be an edge of $C$ of maximum weight\\
\indnt\indnt Set $T$ := $T-e$\\
Return $T$}
