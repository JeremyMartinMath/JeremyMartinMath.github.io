<p>Here is the solid discussed in class on Tuesday.
<br><img src="solid.jpg">

<p>The base of the solid is the unit circle 
<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>y</i><sup>2</sup>=1, and the cross-section at 
<i>x</i> is an equilateral triangle (as shown in the figure below).

<p>As one student suggested in class, the cross-sections
parallel to the base (that is, parallel to the <i>xy</i>-plane)
look sort of like "footballs".

<p>The following figure shows the "bundt cake" discussed in class on Wednesday.
This is the solid obtained by rotating about the <i>y</i>-axis
the area under the graph of <i>y</i>=sin <i>x</i>, between <i>x</i>=0 and <i>x</i>=&pi;.

<p>This figure shows a cross-section perpendicular to the <i>x</i>-axis;
you can see that the plane meets the solid in a sine curve.

<p>This figure shows a cross-section parallel to the <i>xy</i>-plane.
I've drawn the plane in red this time to make the cross-section more easily visible;
you can see that it is an annulus.
