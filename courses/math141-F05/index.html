<h3>Announcements</h3>

<b>12/15:</b>
We have graded all the Math 121/141 final exams and I have assigned letter
grades.  The average raw score in this section of Math 141 was 70.6 / 100,
while the mean across all sections of Math 121/141 was 53.7 / 100.  We
decided to raise the mean by adding 17 points to everyone's raw score.  I
then calculated each student's final average and assigned letter grades
according to the formula announced in the syllabus.

<p>
You should be able to access your grade from <a href="http://www.registrar.ku.edu/">the
Registrar's website</a>
no later than tomorrow morning.  I can also e-mail you your grade upon
request.

<p>
If you wish to see your final exam, please e-mail me to set up an
appointment for next semester (since I will not be on campus for the next
couple of weeks).  University and department policies require that I
retain the actual exam sheets.

<a name="hw"><h3>Homework</h3></a>

<p>
Homework is due in class on Tuesdays.
<b>Homework turned in after the end of class will not be accepted!</b>

<p>
Do all the required problems.  You don't have to turn in the practice
problems, but they include material that may be covered on the common
exams, so may be very helpful for exam review.

<p>
Each homework is worth 15 points.  Four problems on each set
will be graded out of 3 points each.  The remaining 3 points
are awarded for making a reasonable effort at doing all assigned problems.

<a name="gateway"><h3>Gateway Exam</h3></a>

<p>The Gateway Exam tests your technical skill in differentiation, using 
the techniques covered in section 3.1--3.7 of the textbook.</p> The 
official Math 121/141 Gateway Exam handout (which duplicates much of the 
information given below) is available <a 
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~sheu/121commons/121f05gate_info.pdf">here</a>.

<p>The exam consists of ten functions which you will have to 
differentiate, using no calculators, notes or other aids.  The ten 
functions are chosen from a fixed list of 173 functions, which is <a 
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/cgi/gateway/121/problems/">available from the 
Mathematics Department website</a>. You can also <a 
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/cgi/gateway/121/try.cgi/">take a sample exam 
online</a>.</p>

<p>To pass the exam, you must get at least eight of the ten problems 
<b>completely</b> correct.  You don't have to simplify your answers, but 
if you do, then the simplification must also be correct.</p>

<p>The exam is all-or-nothing: you get 100 points for passing and 0 points
for failing.  If you do not pass the first time, you can retake the exam
as specified below.  The ten problems are changed each day, so if you
retake the exam, it is unlikely that any problems will be duplicated.</p>

<p>The exam is offered at the KAP Testing Center, 324 Strong Hall.  It's
untimed; you can take as long as you want to solve the problems (subject
to the Testing Center itself closing).  To take the exam, just go to the
Testing Center at a time of your choosing (see below).  You will need your
KU ID and you will need to list me (Jeremy Martin) as your instructor.</p>

<p>The Gateway exam will be offered during the four-week period of <b>Saturday, October 
8</b> through <b>Friday, November 4</b>, with the exception of Fall Break (Thu 10/13 through 
Sat 10/15) and the following other dates: Thu 10/27, Fri 10/28, Wed 11/2, Thu 11/3.  The 
Testing Center hours are as follows:
  <ul>
  <li>Monday through Thursday: 7:30 AM -- 9:00 PM
  <li>Friday: 7:30 AM -- 5:30 PM
  <li>Saturday: 9:00 AM -- 12 noon
  </ul>
</p>

<p>You can retake the exam up to twice each week (but not twice on the 
same day), for a total of eight tries.  The period from a Saturday through 
the following Friday is counted as one week.</p>

<a name="midterm"><h3>Midterm Exam</h3></a>

<p>
The common Math 121/141 midterm exam, worth 20% of the final
grade, was given on Tuesday, October 11.  The average score in this 
section of Math 141 (25 students) was 64/100; the 
coursewide average (about 300 students) was about 56/100.  To bring the 
average up to the C 
range, we added 16 points to the score of every student in Math 121/141.
Here is a rough breakdown of the results in this section
(<u>before</u> the 16-point adjustment):

<a name="final"><h3>Final Exam</h3></a>

<p> All Math 121/141 students will take a common final exam (worth 30% of 
the final grade) on <b>Wednesday, December 14</b>, from <b>4:30--7:00 
PM</b>, in <b>120 Snow Hall</b>. Please come early, say around 4:15, so 
that we can start on time.

<p> Bring a graphing calculator; we will not have extras available. 
Calculators that are capable of symbolic calculation of differentiation 
and integration, such as the Texas Instruments TI-89 and TI-92, are NOT 
allowed.

<p>The <a
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~sheu/121commons/">Math 121/141 common
website</a> contains a <a 
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~sheu/121commons/121f05fs.pdf">sample final 
exam</a>; an <a
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~sheu/121commons/121f05fs0.pdf">answer key 
for the sample final</a>, and a <a 
href="http://www.math.ku.edu/~sheu/121commons/121f05fr.pdf">longer list of 
sample problems</a>.  <b>Working on all of these problems is the best
way to study for the final exam.</b>

<p>You are responsible for knowing most topics covered in class
throughout the semester; see the <a 
href="http://www.jlmartin.faculty.ku.edu/math141/schedule.html">lecture
schedule</a> for details.  The following topics will NOT be covered on the final 
exam:
<ul>
<li>The precise (epsilon-delta) definition of a limit
<li>Hydrostatic pressure and force
<li>Center of mass
<li>The Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule
<li>Newton's method
<li>Integrals involving special trigonometric substitutions
  (e.g., problems 7--10 in section 5.7)
<li>Integrals involving non-basic partial fractions
  (e.g., Example 5 on pp. 403-404, although Example 4 on pp. 402-403
  is fair game)
</ul>

<p>
On the long-answer questions, you will need to show your work to receive
full credit.  In particular, any computation of a definite integral must
first show explicitly the antiderivative involved.  Without a correct
antiderivative shown, even if the value of the definite integral is
correct, that value itself will be ignored and will not earn credit.
(This does not include certain special cases which can be solved without
any computation, by using simple geometry, e.g. a definite integral of a
constant function, or the integral of the square root of r^2-x^2 from x=-r
to x=r which yields the area of a half-disk.  However, it is always a good
idea to explain what you are doing, even in these special cases.)

<p>
After we finish grading the exam, we may adjust the grades.  Such an
adjustment, if any, will be made uniformly over all sections of Math
121/141, and will depend on what the raw scores look like in aggregate.
For this reason, there is no way to know precisely in advance how well you
need to do on the final to receive a particular letter grade.

<p>
Sometime after the end of exams, KU will send you a grade report by
e-mail.  I don't know when this will happen.  At some point, you will also
be able to <a href="http://www.grades.ku.edu">find out your grade online</a>.
You will <b>not</b> be able to find out your grade by going to the
Student Records office or the Math Department office.

<p>The <a
href="http://www.registrar.ku.edu/timetable/059finals.shtml">KU 
Registrar's website</a> contains
an official exam schedule, as well as a list of KU 
policies governing final exams.
