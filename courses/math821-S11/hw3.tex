\prob Let $p,q$ be distinct points on $S^2$, and let $X$ be the space obtained by gluing
them together.  Determine the homotopy type of $X$.

\prob For $k\geq 1$, let $T_n$ denote the $n$-holed torus.

\probpart Construct a cell complex structure on $T_n$.

\probpart Show that $T_n$ is homotopy-equivalent to the cell complex
$S^1\x(\bigvee_{i=1}^n S^1)$ (that is, take $n$ circles and wedge them together
at a point to get a ``bouquet'', then take the product with another circle).


\prob (Hatcher, p.20, \#22) Let $X$ be a finite graph lying in a half-plane $P\subset\Rr^3$ and intersecting the
edge $e$ of $P$ in a subset of its vertices.  (See figure below.)  Describe the homotopy type of the ``surface of revolution''
obtained by rotating $X$ about $e$.

\prob Recall that for a space $X$ and base point $x\in X$, we have defined $\pi_1(X,x)$ to be
the set of homotopy classes of $x,x$-paths on $X$ --- or equivalently of continuous functions
$S^1\to X$.  Accordingly, define $\pi_0(X,x)$ to be the set of homotopy classes of continuous functions $S^0\to X$.

Describe $\pi_0(X,x)$ intrinsically in terms of $X$.

\prob How generally does the lifting property
(used in the proof of $\pi_1(S^1)\isom\Zz$) hold?
That is, suppose that we have continuous functions $f:X\to Y$
and $p:Z\surj Y$, and we want to find $\tilde f$ such that the following diagram is
commutative.

\begin{equation*}
\xymatrix{
&& Z\ar[dd]^p\\
X\ar[urr]^{\tilde f} \ar[drr]_f\\
&& Y
}
\end{equation*}

What conditions on $X,Y,Z,p$ guarantee that such a lift exists?  (Whatever you come
up with should include the case we needed for the calculation of $\pi_1(S^1)$,
i.e., $X=I$, $Y=S^1$, $Z=\Rr$, $p(t)=e^{2\pi i t}$.)

\prob (Hatcher, p.38, \#2) Show that the change-of-basepoint homomorphism $\beta_h$ (see p.28)
depends only on the homotopy class of the path $h$.

\prob (Hatcher, p.38, \#7) Define $f:S^1\x I\to S^1\x I$ by $f(\theta,s)=(\theta+2\pi s,s)$,
so $f$ restricts to the identity on the two boundary circles of $S^1\x I$.   Show that $f$ is homotopic
to the identity by a homotopy $f_t$ that is stationary on \emph{one} of the boundary circles, but not
by any homotopy $f_t$ that is stationary on \emph{both} boundary circles.
