{\bf Math 821 Problem Set \#4\\

\prob (Hatcher, p.52, \#1) Show that the free product $G*H$ of 
nontrivial groups $G,H$ has trivial center, and that the only elements of 
$G*H$ of finite order are the conjugates of finite-order elements of $G$ 
and $H$.

\prob The \emph{dunce hat} is the space $D$ obtained from a triangle
by identifying all three edges with each other, with the orientations
indicated below.  Give two separate proofs that $D$ is simply-connected.
(There are at least three: (a) show that $D$ is in fact contractible;
(b) use Van Kampen's theorem; (c) a slick one-line proof using something
we did in class.)

\prob Consider the standard picture of the torus $T=S^1\x S^1$
as a quotient space of the square.
Why does the decomposition $T=A_\alpha\cup A_\beta\cup A_\gamma$ shown below,
together with Van Kampen's theorem, \emph{not} imply that $T$
is simply-connected?

\prob (Hatcher, p.53, \#4, modified) Let $n\geq 1$ be an integer, and 
let $X\subset\Rr^3$ be the union of $n$ distinct rays emanating from the 
origin.  Compute $\pi_1(\Rr^3\sm X)$.

(Note: This problem is the tip of an iceberg: the theory of 
\emph{subspace arrangements}.  There are many beautiful theorems about 
the topology of such things, often using tools from areas such as 
algebraic combinatorics and the theory of Coxeter groups.)

\prob Let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be nonzero integers.  
Construct a cell complex $X$ from $S^1$ as follows:
For each $j=1,\dots,n$, attach a $2$-cell to $S^1$ by wrapping
it around the circle $a_j$ times.  Compute $\pi_1(X)$.

\prob (Hatcher, p.53, \#6, modified) Let $X$ be a path-connected cell 
complex, and let $Y$ be a cell complex obtained from $X$ by attaching an 
$n$-cell for some $n\geq 3$.  Show that the inclusion $X\inj Y$ induces 
an isomorphism $\pi_1(X)\isom\pi_1(Y)$.
