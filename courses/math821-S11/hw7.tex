Note: In all cases, ``compute the homology groups'' means ``compute $H_n(X)$ for $n>0$'' -- you don't have to incessantly repeat that $H_0(X)=\Zz$ for path-connected spaces $X$.

\prob [Hatcher p.156 \#9b] Compute the homology groups of $S^1\x(S^1\vee S^1)$.
(Note that this space is \emph{not} homeomorphic to $(S^1\x S^1)\vee(S^1\x S^1)$.)

\bigskip

\prob [Hatcher p.156 \#9c] Compute the homology groups of the space obtained from~$D^2$ by first deleting the interiors of two disjoint subdisks
in the interior of~$D^2$ and then identifying all three resulting boundary circles
together via homeomorphisms preserving clockwise orientations of these circles.

\bigskip

\prob [Hatcher p.156 \#9d] Compute the homology groups of
the quotient space of $S^1\x S^1$ obtained by identifying points in the circle $S^1\x\{x_0\}$
that differ by $2\pi/m$ rotation and identifying points in the circle $\{x_0\}\x S^1$ that
differ by $2\pi/n$ rotation.

\prob [Hatcher p.155 \#2, modified] Given a map $f:S^{2n}\to S^{2n}$, show that there is some point $x\in S^{2n}$
with either $f(x)=x$ or $f(x)=-x$.  Deduce that every map $\RP^{2n}\to\RP^{2n}$ has a fixed point.  (Hint: Lift.)

\bigskip

\prob  [Hatcher p.156 \#15] Show that if $X$ is a CW complex then $H_n(X^n)$
is free, by identifying it with the kernel of the cellular boundary map
$H^n(X^n,X^{n-1})\to H^{n-1}(X^{n-1},X^{n-2})$.  (Hint: Once you understand
how the diagram on p.139 is constructed, the proof is purely algebraic and
should be quite short.)

\bigskip

\prob [Hatcher p.158 \#29]
The surface $M_g$ of genus~$g$, embedded in~$\Rr^3$ in the standard
way, bounds a compact region $R$. Two copies of $R$, glued together by
the identity map between their boundary surfaces~$M_g$, form a closed
3-manifold $X$. Compute the homology groups of $X$ via the
Mayer-Vietoris sequence for this decomposition of $X$ into two copies
of $R$.
