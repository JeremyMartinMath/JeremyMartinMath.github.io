{\bf Math 821 Problem Set \#5\\

\prob In class on Friday, I asserted that if $G$ is a graph with
$n$ vertices and $c$ connected components, and $M$ is the signed
vertex-edge incidence matrix of $G$, then $\rank M=n-c$.  Prove
this statement (over any ground field).

\prob Fix a ground field $\Ff$ and a nonnegative integer $n$.
Let $V_k$ be the vector space with basis $\{\sigma_A\}$, where
$A$ ranges over all $k$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$.
Define a linear transformation $\bd_k:V_k\to V_{k-1}$ as follows:
if $A=\{a_1,\dots,a_k\}$ with $a_1<\cdots<a_k$, then
$$\bd_k(\sigma_A)=\sum_{i=1}^k(-1)^{i+1}\sigma_{A\sm\{a_i\}}.$$
(Having defined $\bd_k$ on the basis elements, it extends
uniquely to all of $V_k$ by linearity.)

\probpart Prove that $d_k\circ d_{k+1}=0$ for all $k$.  (Note: I know this
calculation is done explicitly in Hatcher,
but it is so important that everyone should do it for themselves at least once!)
Conclude that
$$\im\bd_k\subseteq\ker\bd_{k+1}.$$

\probpart For $n=3$, write out the maps $\bd_i$ as explicit
matrices.

\probpart Prove that for every $k$, the set
$\{\bd_k(\sigma_A):\ 1\in A\}$
is a basis for the vector space $\im\bd_k$.

\probpart Use (3) to prove that in fact
$\im\bd_k=\ker\bd_{k+1}.$
(Hint: By (1), all you have to show is that these vector spaces
have the same dimension.)

\prob Consider the matrix
$$A=\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&0\\1&0&1\\0&1&1\end{bmatrix}.$$
Describe $\coker A$
(i) if $A$ is regarded as a linear transformation over $\Qq$;
(ii) if $A$ is regarded as a linear transformation over $\Zz$;
(iii) if $A$ is regarded as a linear transformation over $\Ff_q$
(the finite field with $q$ elements).

\prob Let $R=\Ff[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ be the ring of polynomials in $n$ 
variables over a field $\Ff$. A \emph{squarefree monomial} in $R$ is a 
product of distinct indeterminates (e.g., $x_1x_4x_5$, but not 
$x_1x_5^2$). Let $I$ be an ideal generated by squarefree monomials of 
degree $\geq 2$.

\probpart  Show that the set
  $$\Delta=\{\sigma\subset[n] \st \prod_{i\in\sigma} x_i\not\in I\}$$
is an abstract simplicial complex on $n$ vertices.

(This is called the
\emph{Stanley-Reisner complex} of $I$ --- or, alternately, $I$ is the 
Stanley-Reisner ideal of $\Delta$.)

\probpart  Describe  $\Delta$
looks like in the case 
that $I$ is (i) the zero ideal; (ii) generated by a single monomial
of degree~$d$; (iii) generated by all monomials of degree~$d$ for some $k\leq n$;
(iv) (assuming $n=2m$ is even) generated by the degree-2 monomials $x_1x_2$,
$x_3x_4$, \dots, $x_{2m-1}x_{2m}$.

\end{document}
\prob Find an explicit triangulation $\Delta$ of $\Rr P^2$ with
6 vertices, 15 edges and 10 faces.  (Hint: Draw the cell complex
picture and start subdividing.)

Compute the simplicial homology groups $H_k(\Delta;\Qq)$ of
\bang $\Delta$;
\bang $\Delta\sm\{\sigma\}$, where $\sigma$ is a single 2-simplex (does 
it matter which?);
\bang $\Delta\sm\{\sigma,\tau\}$, where $\sigma,\tau$ are (different) 
2-simplices (does it matter which?);
\bang $\Delta\cup\{\rho\}$, where $\rho$ is a 2-simplex not belonging to $\Delta$.
(By ``compute'', I mean ``determine up to isomorphism''.

You can do this in a computer algebra system such as Macaulay2.

\pagebreak

Macaulay2 is a free software system to do computations in commutative algebra.

To run Macaulay2, log into your math account,
open a terminal window, and type ``M2''.  You'll see something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Macaulay2, version 1.4
with packages: ConwayPolynomials, Elimination, IntegralClosure, LLLBases,
               PrimaryDecomposition, ReesAlgebra, TangentCone
i1 : 
\end{verbatim}
You can compute the kernel of a matrix directly:
\begin{verbatim}
i1 : A=matrix{{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}

o1 = | 1 2 3 |
     | 4 5 6 |

              2        3
o1 : Matrix ZZ  <--- ZZ

i2 : ker A

o2 = image | -1 |
           | 2  |
           | -1 |

                               3
o2 : ZZ-module, submodule of ZZ

i3 : 
\end{verbatim}
By default, M2 works over $\Zz$ (that's what \texttt{ZZ} means).
Here I have typed in a $2\x3$ matrix $A$ corresponding
to a linear transformation $\Zz^3\to\Zz^2$ (for various reasons,
Macaulay writes the arrows right to left) and computed
its kernel, which Macaulay has described as the image (i.e.,
column space) of the matrix $B=\begin{bmatrix}-1\\2\\-1\end{bmatrix}$.

If you have a $\Zz$-module and you just want to know what it is
up to isomorphism, you can use the \texttt{prune} command:
\begin{verbatim}
i3 : prune ker A

       1
o3 = ZZ

o3 : ZZ-module, free
\end{verbatim}
Here is a computation of the homology of the complete graph
