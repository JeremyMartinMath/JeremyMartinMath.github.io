<h3>Math 290 Homework #1<br>
Due date: Thursday, August 24</h3>

<h4>Section 1.1 (pp. 11--13)</h4>

  <b>#1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6.</b> You can just say "yes" or "no" for each 
of these.<br>
  <b>#12, #13.</b><br>
  <b>#22, #23.</b> You shouldn't really need a graphing calculator for 
these, but you can use one if you want.<br>
  <b>#55, #56.</b><br>
  <b>#59(b), #60(a,c).</b>  Here, just saying "true" or "false" is 
not sufficient; you really need to give a reason.<br>
  <b>#69, #70.</b><br>

<h4>Section 1.2 (pp. 25--28)</h4>

  <b>#7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12.</b><br>
  <b>#25.</b> Do this by Gaussian elimination with back-substitution.  
Write out every step you take in the elimination process, and explain what 
you are doing (e.g., "swap R<sub>2</sub> and R<sub>3</sub>", "subtract 3/2 
times R<sub>3</sub> from R<sub>1</sub>", etc.)  You can use Example 6 (pp. 
20--21) as a model for what your complete answer should look like.  When 
you're done, check your answer against the one given in the back of the 
book.  If it isn't the same, go back and try to find where you went 
wrong.<br>
  <b>#26.</b> Do this by Gauss-Jordan elimination.  Write out and explain 
every step, just like #25.<br>
  <b>#27.</b> Do this by either Gaussian elimination with 
back-substitution or by Gauss-Jordan elimination, as you prefer.<br>
  <b>#42.</b> Think hard about what this means!<br>
  <b>#61.</b> Before you look in the back of the book, think about how to
convert this into a system of linear equations.
