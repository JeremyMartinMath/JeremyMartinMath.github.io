<h3>Math 290 Homework #2<br>
Due date: Thursday, August 31</h3>

<h4>Section 1.3 (pp. 37--39)</h4>

  <b>#3, #4.</b><br>
  <b>#12.</b> This is a little bit different from the other problems, but if
you remember the general form of the equation of a circle is then you should
be able to solve the problem by solving a system of linear equations.<br>
  <b>#19.</b> The problems labeled "Guided Proof" typically don't involve
very difficult mathematics.  Instead, their point is to show you how
to solve a longer problem by breaking it into a series of simpler steps that
are logically connected.  In your answer, try to focus on explaining each of
these simple steps in a clear way.<br>
  <b>#23, #24, #25.</b><br>

<h4>Section 2.1 (pp. 55--59)</h4>

  <b>#1, #5, #8, #9, #12, #17, #18, #31, #32.</b>  This might feel
like a lot of "busy work".  My goal is not to bore you senseless,
but to give you some practice with
the basic algebra of matrices, so that you will feel comfortable when we do
more exciting things.<br>
  <b>#37.</b> See the remarks on "Guided Proof" problems above.<br>
  <b>#42.</b> This one is not labeled as a "Guided Proof"; however, you should
structure your solution in a similar way, breaking the problem into small steps
and explaining each step clearly.
