<h3>Math 290 Homework #3<br>
Due date: Thursday, September 7</h3>

<h4>Section 2.1 (pp. 55--59)</h4>

  <b>#39, #40, #41, #43.</b><br>
  <b>#49.</b> The <u>converse</u> of a statement of the form "If P, then 
Q" is the statement "If Q, then P".  So the second part of this problem 
asks you to prove that the following statement is <u>false</u>: "if the 
<i>i</i>th row of <i>AB</i> has all zero entries, then so does the 
<i>i</i>th row of <i>A</i>."  To carry out this proof, you need to 
construct a pair of matrices <i>A</i>, <i>B</i> such that the <i>i</i>th 
row of <i>AB</i> has all zero entries, but the <i>i</i>th row of <i>A</i> 
does not.


<h4>Section 2.2 (pp. 69--71)</h4>

  <b>#9, #23, #24.</b><br>
  <b>#37, #38.</b> The goal, of course, is to give the right answer <u>without</u>
having to actually calculate every single one of the matrices <i>A</i><sup>2</sup>,
<i>A</i><sup>3</sup>, ...., <i>A</i><sup>19</sup>, A<sup>20</sup>.<br>
  <b>#50, #53.</b>
