<h2>Math 290 Review Information</h2>

<h3>Exam Topics</h3>

<p>
What follows is a list of the sections of the textbook for which you are responsible.
In general, the &quot;Chapter Summary&quot; at the end of each chapter contains a pretty
good &quot;skill set&quot; of basic things you should know how to do.  If you're not comfortable
with any of the items in those lists, there are lots of problems in the textbook to
practice.  If you think you're pretty comfortable with these basic skills, the best way to study is to
work on problems that require proofs or explanations.  Solving those kinds of problems -- and, especially,
being able to explain your solutions to another student -- are a great way to deepen your understanding
of mathematics.
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Chapter 1</b> (<i>Systems of Linear Equations</i>)<br>

You are responsible for the whole chapter, except for the material on networks
(pp. 32-36).  The Chapter Summary is on p.40.

<li><b>Chapter 2</b> (<i>Matrices</i>)<br>

You are responsible for 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3.  Most of this is material you are probably pretty
familiar with, so if you are comfortable with the first eight items in the Chapter Summary on p.114, you 
probably don't need to spend too much time working on problems from this chapter.

<li><b>Chapter 3</b> (<i>Determinants</i>)<br>

You are responsible for sections 3.1 through 3.4.  We didn't &quot;officially&quot; cover 3.4 
but at this
point (having done 7.1) you should be able to read it and have it make sense.
The applications in Section 3.5 (adjoints, Cramer's Rule, geometry) won't appear on the exam.
Again, the Chapter Summary list on p.166 is a good resource.

<li><b>Chapter 4</b> (<i>Vector Spaces</i>)<br>

You are responsible for sections 4.1 through 4.6.  In the Chapter Summar,
you should be comfortable with everything on p.264 and the first three items on p.265.

<li><b>Chapter 6</b> (<i>Linear Transformations</i>)<br>

You are responsible for all of 6.1 and 6.2, and most of 6.3 (but not &quot;Nonstandard bases and 
General Vector Spaces&quot; on pp.384-387.  Things you should know how to do include all but the 
last three items of the Chapter Summary on pp.404-405.

<li><b>Chapter 7</b> (<i>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</i>)<br>

You are responsible for section 7.1.  Section 7.2, which we talked about in class last 
Thursday, will not appear on the exam.  Only the first item from the Chapter Summary (pp. 
460-461) applies.  You should also understand why the characteristic equation of a 
matrix is what it is, and know what an eigenspace of a matrix is and how to find it.

</ul>

<h3>Practice Problems</h3>

<a href="review.pdf">Here</a> is a sampling of <a 
href="review.pdf">review problems</a>.  
These tend to be harder than the problems in the textbook.  Many of them
involve more than one topic (as will several problems in the exam).
