<h3>Math 290 Homework #8<br>
Due date: Thursday, October 19</h3>

<h4>Section 4.1 (pp. 183--185)</h4>

<p><b>#49, #50, #51, #52.</b>  The idea of these problems is to give you 
some practice constructing simple proofs.  You can use the proof of 
Theorem 4.3 on p.181 as a model.  The justification for each step
can either be something like "associative property", "commutative 
property", etc., or can be a specific reference (e.g., "Theorem 4.2, part 
4").

<h4>Section 4.2 (pp. 191--192)</h4>

<p><b>#1, #2, #5, #6, #7, #8, #11, #12,
#15, #16, #19, #20, #21, #22.</b>
