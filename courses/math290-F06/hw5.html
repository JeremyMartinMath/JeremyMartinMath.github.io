<h4>Section 2.5 (pp. 110--113)</h4>

  <b>#7, #10.</b><br>
  <b>#13.</b>  Just giving an example is not enough!  Instead, write down
two stochastic 2x2 matrices A = [a<sub>ij</sub>] and B = [b<sub>ij</sub>],
calculate their product AB, and use the "stochasticity" of A and B to check
that AB is also stochastic.
