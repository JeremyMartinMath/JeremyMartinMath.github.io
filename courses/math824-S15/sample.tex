\section*{Foreword}
The starting point for these lecture notes was my notes from Vic
Reiner's Algebraic Combinatorics course at the University of Minnesota
in Fall 2003.  I currently use them for graduate courses at the
University of Kansas.  They will always be a work in
progress.  Please use them and share them freely for any research
purpose.  I have added and subtracted some material from Vic's course
to suit my tastes, but any mistakes are my own; if you find one,
please contact me at {\tt jlmartin@ku.edu} so I can fix it.
Thanks to those who have suggested additions and pointed out errors,
including but not limited to: Logan Godkin, Alex Lazar, Nick Packauskas, Billy Sanders,
and Tony Se.

\section{The Fundamentals: Posets, Simplicial Complexes, and Polytopes}

\subsection{Posets}

\begin{definition}
A \defterm{partially ordered set} or \defterm{poset} is a set~$P$ equipped with a relation~$\leq$ that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.  That is, for all $x,y,z\in P$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x\leq x$ (reflexivity).
\item If $x\leq y$ and $y\leq x$, then $x=y$ (antisymmetry).
\item If $x\leq y$ and $y\leq z$, then $x\leq z$ (transitivity).
\end{enumerate}
We say that $x$ is \defterm{covered} by $y$, written $x\coveredby y$, if $x<y$
and there exists no $z$ such that $x<z<y$.  Two posets $P,Q$ are \defterm{isomorphic} if there is a bijection $\phi:P\to Q$ that is order-preserving; that is, $x\leq y$ in $P$ iff $\phi(x)\leq\phi(y)$ in $Q$.
\end{definition}

We'll usually assume that $P$ is finite.


\begin{definition} A poset $L$ is a \defterm{lattice} if every pair $x,y\in L$
has a unique \defterm{meet} $x\meet y$ and \defterm{join} $x\join y$.  That is,
  \begin{align*}
  x\meet y &= \max\{z\in L ~|~ z\leq x,y\},\\
  x\join y &= \min\{z\in L ~|~ z\geq x,y\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
We'll have a lot more to say about lattices in Section~\ref{lattice-section}.

\begin{example}[\textbf{Boolean algebras}]
Let $[n]=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ (a standard piece of notation in combinatorics)
and let $2^{[n]}$ be the power set of $[n]$.  We can partially order $2^{[n]}$ by
writing $S\leq T$ if $S\subseteq T$.  A poset isomorphic to $2^{[n]}$ is called a \defterm{Boolean algebra of rank~$n$.}

Note that $2^{[n]}$ is a lattice, with meet and join given by intersection and union respectively.
\end{example}
