Dania Morales (Willamette University)<br>
<i>Matroids and Shellable Simplicial Complexes</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> While any simplicial complex can be assembled one 
facet at a time, shellable simplicial complexes can be assembled with 
nice topology at each step. In this talk, we focus on simplicial 
complexes that arise from a given matroid. After reviewing matroids and 
related simplicial complexes that are known to be shellable, we define a 
new simplicial complex. We call our complex the augmented external 
activity complex and we describe a family of shelling orders. This talk 
is based on joint work with Andrew Berget.

<p><strong>Friday 4/11</strong><br>
Tian-Xiao He (Illinois Western University)<br>
<i>Some Topics on Riordan Arrays and the Riordan Group</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> In this talk, we present double almost-Riordan 
arrays and the double almost-Riordan group. We also give the sequence 
characteristics of double almost-Riordan arrays and the production 
matrices of two types for double almost-Riordan arrays. In addition, we 
discuss the algebraic properties of the double almost-Riordan group, and 
finally give the compression of double almost-Riordan arrays and their 
total positivity. If time permits, we will present some recent results 
on the Riordan semigroup and embeddability of Coxeter groups into the 
Riordan group.

<p><strong>Friday 4/18</strong><br>
No seminar -- please attend the Distinguished Lecture by David Eisenbud
(4:00pm, Snow 120).

<p><strong>Friday 4/25</strong><br>
Chris Uchizono<br>
<i>Restricted quiver mutation and n-face urban renewal in dimer models</i>

<p><u>Abstract:</u> Quivers that arise from triangulations of surfaces 
have been extensively studied by Fomin, Shapiro, and Thurston in the 
context of flips of triangulations. In this talk, we introduce 
restricted quiver mutation as a mild generalization of flips of 
triangulations and how this generalization can be connected to a variant 
of urban renewal in dimer models via Derksen, Weyman, and Zelevinsky's 
mutation of quivers with potential.

<p><strong>Friday 5/2</strong><br>
